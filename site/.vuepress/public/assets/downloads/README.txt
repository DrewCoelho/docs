# Put Your Title Here

<PageHeader />

General description goes here. You can also include a badge tag like so:

**Tags:**
<badge text='encryption' vertical='middle' />

Other notes:

- There should only be one `#` section in an article. 
- Leave the `<PageHeader/>` and `<PageFooter/>` tags where they are. 
- This file should be left as `README.md` and you should place it inside a folder that represents the article name. 
- Any images that you want to include inline should be placed in that folder too.

```
* article-name (this is the folder)
  * image1.png (an image for the article)
  * image3.png (another image for the article)
  * README.md (this file/the article you just made)
```

If your article needs to reference a file for download like a `.docx` or a `.pdf`, please place it into the `site/.vuepress/public/assets/downloads` directory and link to it like so:

`[link-text](/assets/downloads/file-to-download.pdf)`

## Descriptive Sub Section

More information here. You can have as many `##` sections as you'd like.

### Sub Sub Section

- You can nest `##`-`######` for up to six levels of sub-sections.
- You can _italicize_ by wrapping text like `_italicize_` or `*italicize*`
- You can __bold__ by wrapping text like `__bold__` or `**bold**`
