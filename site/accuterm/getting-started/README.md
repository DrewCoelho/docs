This getting started guide walks you through the process of setting up your Zumasys Customer Portal account, assigning your organization's AccuTerm licenses to your account, adding users and assigning AccuTerm licenses to those users. Additional instructions can be found on how to create roles and profiles for AccuTerm Web and how to install AccuTerm IO on your MultiValue server.

   * Once your user has been created, [Jill](mailto:jillo@zumasys.com) will assign you as the Portal Admin and grant you access to the licenses.  
1. Create your users and assign licenses ([Creating Users](./../license-and-user-management/creating-users/README.md))
