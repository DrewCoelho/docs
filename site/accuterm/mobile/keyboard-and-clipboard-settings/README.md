# Keyboard & Clipboard Settings

<PageHeader />

The Keyboard Settings panel is to specify keyboard options and open the keyboard programming window.

Most terminals provide commands that allow the host to program the function keys. If you would like the host to be able to reset and reprogram the keys, select the Unlocked – host can reset or reprogram keys option. If you would like the host to be able to reprogram keys, but not reset them to their default values, select the Locked – host cannot reset keys to defaults option. If you would like to prevent the host from resetting or reprogramming keys, select the Locked – host cannot reset or reprogram keys option.

Paste Options: end-of-line When the clipboard is "pasted" to an AccuTerm session, AccuTerm transmits the clipboard text to the host computer. The end of line options determine what AccuTerm does at the end of each line: send CR (default), send LF, send CF+ LF, send TAB, do nothing, or send a user-defined character. To specify a user-defined character, select the user-defined option and enter the ASCII code of the character to be sent at the end of each line.
