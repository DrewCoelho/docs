Profiles define a terminal session, and are analogous to the session configuration files (.atsp, .atcf) used by AccuTerm Desktop. A profile defines the server name or IP to connect to, terminal type, color theme, function keys, screen size, and other settings. The .atsp file used by AccuTerm 8 Desktop is essentially a profile, and in the future you will be able to upload an .atsp file created by AccuTerm 8 Desktop as a profile to use with AccuTerm Web. Each profile must be assigned to one or more roles.

## Info

Prior to creating a user, you will need to have already created your [Customer Portal User](./../../../customer-portal/registration/README.md) and be assigned as an Administrator to your company's account.

1. Expand the AccuTerm module from the main navigation page in the Customer Portal and select Profiles.
