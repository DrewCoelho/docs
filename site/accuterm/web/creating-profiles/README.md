Profiles define a terminal session, and are analogous to the session configuration files (.atsp, .atcf) used by AccuTerm Desktop. A profile defines the server name or IP to connect to, terminal type, color theme, function keys, screen size, and other settings. The .atsp file used by AccuTerm 8 Desktop is essentially a profile, and in the future you will be able to upload an .atsp file created by AccuTerm 8 Desktop as a profile to use with AccuTerm Web. Each profile must be assigned to one or more roles.
