**Internal:** No  

## Description

This command deletes a specified formqueue. It takes the general form:

```
SP-FQDELETE formqueue
```

where **formqueue** is the name of the formqueue to be deleted.

**formqueue** cannot be deleted if it is not empty or is assigned to logical device type.  
The formqueue should be changed to a device type of zero and any print jobs either deleted or reassigned to another formqueue. Any processes currently assigned to the deleted formqueue will change to NO QUEUE and any attempt to spool a job will display an error message.

If used without the **formqueue** argument, the user will be prompted to enter the name of the formqueue they wish to delete as:

```
QUEUE-NAME:
```

The user will then enter the formqueue to be deleted.
