## Description

This command will pause all database operations, through jEDI, to the jBASE database. It takes the general form:

```
DB-PAUSE options
```

where options may be:

- **a** - option means that administrators (e.g. root users on UNIX) can still make updates to the database.
- **n** - option specifies the database to pause (This option is restricted to jBASE 5)
- **r** - option still allows read operations on the database and therefore only pauses updates.
- **-** option permits users inside a transaction to continue until it terminates the transaction by either a commit ([TRANSEND](./../../../jbase-basic-%28jbc%29/transend)) or a rollback ([TRANSABORT](./../../../jbase-basic-%28jbc%29/transabort)).

The command can be run a number of times with different options. For example, run it with the -a option to allow root users continued access then when sure all normal users are paused, run it again without the -a option, which will suspend the updates for all users.

An example of use use is as:

```
# DB-PAUSE
DatajBASE paused at Mon Nov 25 15:59:53 2002
For READ and WRITE operations
Updates are denied also to root users
Transactions will be blocked immediately.
```

## Note

> This utility is only available in jBASE 4.1 and later.
