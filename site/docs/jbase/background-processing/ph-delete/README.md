## DescriptionÂ 

The jBASE PH-DELETE command deletes a port number allocated for the jBASE background task processes. The command may be as:

```
PH-DELETE {port {port }} {(Options}
```

with the user being prompted as:

```
PORT TO DELETE ?
```



Where:

- port- port number to delete
- port port- specifies that all ports with the range are to be deleted


and options may be as:

- F- delete port numbers for foreground processes
- B- delete port numbers for background processes




### NOTES

Enter the port number to delete from the available list of jBASE background ports. The port number is not available for jBASE background processes until allocated by the PH-ALLOCATE command.

As of jBASE 5.2.31, the user does not require root privileges for this command.



### EXAMPLE

```
PH-DELETE
PORT TO DELETE ? 100
100 DELETED FROM SERVICE
```

Port number 100 is no longer available for use by jBASE background task processes.
