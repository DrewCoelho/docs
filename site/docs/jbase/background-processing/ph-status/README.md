## Description 

The jBASE **PH-STATUS** command displays status and history information for each jBASE background task process. The information is read from the **$JBCRELEASEDIR/tmp/PH-HISTORY** file.

Output is sorted **BY STATUS-ALPHA BY-DSND START-DATE BY-DSND START-TIME**

The command takes the general form:

```
PH-STATUS {-L1 | -L2} {task-id port} {(Options}
```

Where:

- **-L1** is the default display format
- -**L2** is an alternate display format
- **task-id** is the name of the jBASE background task process specified in the [**PH-START**](./../ph-start) procedure. Use an asterisk (\*) to indicate that you want all tasks for **port** which is the port number of the jBASE background task process for which to limit the display.
- **-h**Help page
- **-?**Help page


and options:

- **P** Redirect output to the spooler.
- **N**No paging


The output can be restricted by specifying one or more valid status codes as options (See example below).



### **Note:**


> The information displayed in the PH-STATUS screen is contained in columns:
> 
> ```
> TASK-ID..LINE ACCOUNT. STARTER-ACC DATE....... TIME.. STATUS OP OUTFL#
> ```
