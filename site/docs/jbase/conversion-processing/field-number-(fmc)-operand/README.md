## Description

Specifies a field which contains the value to be used. It takes the form:

```
 field-number{R{R}}
```

where:

- **field-number** is the number of the field (FMC) which contains the required value.
- **R** specifies that the value obtained from this field is to be applied repeatedly for each multivalue not present in a corresponding part of the calculation.
- **RR** specifies that the value obtained from this field is to be applied repeatedly for each subvalue not present in a corresponding part of the calculation.

## Note

> The following field numbers have special meanings:
>
> - 0 - Record Key
> - 9998- Sequential record count
> - 9999 Record size in bytes

### Example

```
A;2
```

Returns the value stored in field 2 of the record.

```
A;9999
```

Returns the size of the record in bytes.

```
A;2 + 3R
```

For each multivalue in field 2 the system also obtains the (first) value in field 3 and adds it. If field 2 contains 1]7 and field 3 contains 5 the result would be two values of 6 and 12 respectively. Where 3 does not have a corresponding multivalue, the last non-null multivalue in 3 will be used.

```
A;2 + 3RR
```

For each subvalue in field 2 the system also obtains the corresponding subvalue in field 3 and adds it. If field 2 contains 1\2\3]7 and field 3 contains 5\4 the result would be five values of 6, 6, 7, 12 and 4 respectively.
