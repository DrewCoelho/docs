## Description

The MD code transforms integers by scaling them and inserting symbols, such as a currency sign, thousands separators, and a decimal point. The ML and MR codes are similar to MD but have greater functionality. It's general from is as:

```
MDn{m}{Z}{,}{$}{ix}{c}
```

where:

- **n** is a number from 0 to 9 that specifies how many digits are to be output after the decimal point. Trailing zeros are inserted as necessary. If **n** is omitted or 0, the decimal point is not output.
- **m** is a number from 0 to 9 which represents the number of digits that the source value contains to the right of the implied decimal point. **m** is used as a scaling factor and the source value is descaled (divided) by that power of 10. For example, if **m**=1, the value is divided by 10; if **m**=2, the value is divided by 100, and so on. If **m** is omitted, it is assumed to be equal to **n** (the decimal precision). If **m** is greater than **n**, the source value is rounded up or down to **n** digits. The **m** option must be present if the **ix** option is used and both the **Z** and **$** options are omitted. This to remove ambiguity with the **ix** option.
- **Z** suppresses leading zeros. Note that fractional values which have no integer will have a zero before the decimal point. If the value is zero, a null will be output.
- **,** specifies insertion of the thousands separator symbol every three digits to the left of the decimal point. The type of separator (comma or period) is specified through the **SET-THOU** command. (Use the **SET-DEC** command to specify the decimal separator.)
- **$** appends an appropriate currency symbol to the number. The currency symbol is specified through the SET-MONEY command.
- **ix** aligns the currency symbol by creating a blank field of "i" number of columns. The value to be output overwrites the blanks. The "x" parameter specifies a filler character that can be any non-numeric character, including a space.
- **c** appends a credit character or encloses the value in angle brackets (&lt;&gt;). Can be any one of the following:
- **-**Â Appends a minus sign to negative values. Positive or zero values are followed by a blank.
- **+** Appends a plus sign to positive values or a minus sign to negative values.
- **C** Appends the characters **CR** to negative values. Positive or zero values are followed by two blanks.
- **D** Appends the characters **DB** to positive values. Negative values are followed by two blanks. -0 is the same as 0.

### Input Conversion

Input conversion works with a number that has only thousands separators and a decimal point.

### Examples

| MD Code | Source Value | Returned Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MD2 | 1234567 | 12345.67 |
| MD2, | 1234567 | 12,345.67 |
| MD2,$ | 1234567 | $12,345.67 |
| MD2,$12\* | 1234567 | $\*\*12,345.67 |
| MD2,$12- | -1234567 | $12,345.67- |
| MD42Z,$ | 001234567 | $12,345.6700 |
| MD42Z,$15 &lt; | -001234567 | &lt;$ 12,345.6700&gt; |
