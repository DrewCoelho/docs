**Internal:** No  

## Description

The **$merge()** method combines (merges) one object into another object, optionally specifying which object takes precedence if both objects contain Â the same properties.

## Syntax

```
destination->$merge(source{,1})
destination->$merge(source,0)
```

## Arguments


| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The **source** object's properties takes precedence (default) |
| 0 | The **destination** object's properties takes precedence |

If no argument is specified and the **source** and **destination** contain the same property then the **source** takes precedence. These two statements are the same:

```
destination->$merge(source)
destination->$merge(source,1)
```

## Return value

The merged object.

## Examples

```
equ format to 5
philosopher = new object
philosopher->name = "Protagoras"
philosopher->is_sophist = @true
philosopher->fee_in_drachma = 50
quotes = new object
quotes->quote1 = "Man is the measure of all things."
quotes->quote2 = "As to gods, I have no way of knowing either that they exist or do not exist, or what they are like."
crt philosopher->$merge(quotes)->$tojson(format)
```

Result:

```
{
    "name":"Protagoras",
    "is_sophist":1,
    "fee_in_drachma":50,
    "quote1":"Man is the measure of all things.",
    "quote2":"As to gods, I have no way of knowing either that they exist or do not exist, or what they are like."
}
```

This next example simply illustrates what happens when the same property exists in both the source and destination objects:

```
equ formatted to 5
source = new object
source->name = "Zumasys"
source->location = "Left Coast"
destination = new object
destination->name = "jBASE"
destination->timezone = "Pacific"
crt destination->$merge(source)->$tojson(formatted)
```

Result:

```
{
"name":"Zumasys",
"timezone":"Pacific",
"location":"Left Coast"
}
```

To force the destination to take precedence then change the last line to:

```
crt destination->$merge(source,0)->$tojson(formatted)
```

or:

```
crt source->$merge(destination)->$tojson(formatted)
```

## Notes

Objects can only be merged into other objects, you cannot merge an object with an array (and vice versa). Attempting to do so will produce unpredictable results.
