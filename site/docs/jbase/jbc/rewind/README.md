The **REWIND** statement will issue a rewind command to the device attached to the specified channel. It takes the general form:

REWIND{ON expression} THEN|ELSE statements
```

Where:

**expression**, if specified, should evaluate to an integer in the range 0 to 9. Default is 0.

If the statement successfully issues the rewind command then the **statements** associated with any **THEN** clause are executed. Either or both of the **THEN** and **ELSE** clauses must be specified with the statement.
>

>
> | Value | Meaning |
> | --- | --- |
> | 1 | There is no media attached to the channel |
