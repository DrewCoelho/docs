## Description 

This command reads and locks a record from an open file into a file buffer. It takes the general form:

```
F-UREAD file-buffer key error-cmd-line
```

or

```
F-UR file-buffer key error-cmd-line
```

where:

- file-buffer is the number (1 to 9) of the file buffer with which the file is associated.
- key is the key of the record to be read and locked. Can be a literal (not enclosed in quotes), or a direct or indirect reference to a buffer or select register.
- error-cmd-line is the line immediately after the F-UREAD command. Only executed if the specified record cannot be read.


The F-UREAD command is identical to the F-READ  command, except that it also locks the record against access by another process, thus eliminating simultaneous updates. Any attempt to F-UREAD a record, which is already locked, will be suspended until the other process unlocks the record. Record locks are released by F-DELETE, F-WRITE  or F-FREE commands, or when the program terminates.



## Note: 


> It is good practice to F-UREAD a record before you create it. This will reserve the key in the file and avoid double updates. Remember though that the command line immediately following the F-UREAD command will be executed because the record does not exist.
