## Description Â 

Prompts for input, places the entered data in the secondary input buffer as a single parameter and maintains embedded spaces. The secondary input buffer becomes as the active input buffer.

```
IBN{c}
```

where c is an optional prompt character, which, once used, remains in effect until a new IBN, IBP, IN or IP command is issued. If c is not specified, the prompt character will default to the last prompt character used, or to a colon (:).



## Note:


> The IBN command is similar to the IN command except that the input string is placed in the buffer as a single parameter and all spaces are maintained. The new data replaces the content of the secondary input buffer, and the secondary input buffer will remain active until an [RI](./../jcl-ri) , [S](./../jcl-s)(n) or [MV](./../jcl-mv) %n source command is used. If the user responds with ENTER only, a null parameter will be created.
