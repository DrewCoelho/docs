## Description 

The command reads a tape record into the primary input buffer. It takes the general form:

```
IT{C}{A}
```

where:

- C performs an EBCDIC to ASCII  conversion before the data is put into the buffer.
- A masks 8-bit ASCII  characters to 7 bits (resets the most significant bit to a 0).




## Note: 


> The IT command will read a tape record into the primary input buffer. The new data will be placed at the beginning of the buffer and will replace all existing buffer data.
