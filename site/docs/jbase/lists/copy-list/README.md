## Description 

Copies a saved list to another list or to another file. It takes the general form:

```
COPY-LIST {from_listname} {from_accountname} {(options} TO: {to_spec}
```

where:

- **from\_listname** specifies the source list. If you do not specify from\_listname, the default list will be used.
- **from\_accountname** specifies the source account if different to the current account.
- **to\_spec** specifies the destination list. Can be:


```
{to_listname} {to_accountname}
```

or

```
({DICT }to_filename {to_record_key}
```

Use the first variant if attempting to copy the list or change the account it's attached to. Use the second variant attempting to copy the list to a data file. Each key becomes a separate field in the list record. Note use of the left parenthesis before to\_filename.

- If  to\_spec is unspecified, the list will be copied to the default list.
- option may be:



| Option<br> | Description<br> |
| --- | --- |
