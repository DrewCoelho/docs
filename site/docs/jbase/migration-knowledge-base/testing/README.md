# Introduction

This document is intended for reviewing testing process during your journey of converting to jBase.  It will explain the elements of testing and responsibilities of each party.  *Testing is the responsibility of the customer*.  We at Zumasys are excellent technologists but we do not work in your business, understand your business work flows, or understand how to use your applications (the way your users may).  Therefore, it is imperative that you, the customer, take responsibility for the testing of the system to ensure that the migrated system behaves precisely as your current system.

## Test Plan

You will define a test plan that includes all critical work flows involving the migrated applications.  Generally, your application menus will provide a good framework for testing.  Our engineers can use pre-developed utilities or create new utilities to convert your menus into test steps that can be used to track the progress of the testing.   Ultimately, however, some additional detail will need to be defined in the test plan to ensure that all critical process steps are tested.  We have outlined a general guideline for testing from our previous migrations that might assist you in defining a test plan.

## Jira – Issue reporting software

At Zumasys, we are constantly striving to improve our processes.  We are currently using Jira, a software bug reporting software to report issues during the testing and post go-live phase.  Below you will find instructions on how to get started with Jira.

When reporting issues, please make sure to enter in as much details as you can about how you received the error, the method used to get to the error such as menu numbers. Additionally, if possible, always include screenshots.  Please see below for an example of an issue reported:

### Customer Reporting:

- Brief description of the issue
- Menu sequence
- Any attachments – screenshots


### Example:

Description of the issue: Month end Report shows unassigned variable.

User id: DanE

Menu sequence: 17, 5, 11, 05/12/17, 05/17/17, Y, Y, Y
