# jCURL

jCURL is a module that provides curl/http functionality in jBC (BASIC). 

One of the advantages of using curl over other tcp/ip based operations is that when issuing multiple commands to the same host the connection will persist thus improving overall performance.

It provides the following functions:

* [curlAddHeader](./curlAddHeader)
* [curlClose](./curlClose)
* [curlExec](./curlExec)
* [curlGetLog](./curlGetLog)
* [curlInit](./curlInit)
* [curlLastError](./curlLastError)
* [curlSetLogging](./curlSetLogging)
* [curlSetOpt](./curlSetOpt)
* [curlUseFile](./curlUseFile)
* [curlUseMemory](./curlUseMemory)
* [curlUseVar](./curlUseVar)

### Additional Helper Functions
These functions help facilitate simple http/SOAP requests (utilising jCURL underneath) using an **$http** (jabba) class.

* [addRequestParameter](./addRequestParameter)
* [createRequest](./createRequest)
* [setRequestContent](./setRequestContent)
* [setRequestHeader](./setRequestHeader)
* [submitRequest](./submitRequest)
* [SOAPCreateRequest](./SOAPCreateRequest)
* [SOAPSetRequestContent](./SOAPSetRequestContent)
* [SOAPSubmitRequest](./SOAPSubmitRequest)

## Sample Usage

```
    INCLUDE JBCCURL.h

    url = 'http://postman-echo.com/post'
    body = 'This is expected to be sent back as part of response body.'

    rc = curlInit(curlHandle)
    IF rc NE CURLE_OK THEN
        CRT 'Fatal error: curlInit failed to allocate handle'
        STOP
    END

    rc = curlSetOpt(curlHandle, CURLOPT_URL, url)
    IF rc NE CURLE_OK THEN GO failed ;! GO{TO}s used to simplify this example

    rc = curlSetOpt(curlHandle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, body)
    IF rc NE CURLE_OK THEN GO failed

    rc = curlExec(curlHandle, result, header)
    IF rc NE CURLE_OK THEN GO failed
    CRT
    CRT 'result'
    CRT result
    CRT
    CRT 'header'
    CRT header

    STOP

failed:
    CRT curlLastError(curlHandle)
```

```
