This article and accompanying video will provide you with an overview of steps and questions or a checklist to be reviewed an answered as preparation for a migration to jBASE.



## Source

1. Where is it?
    - It is usual to locate source in development accounts, but it may be mixed with data.
2. What is it?
    - Basic, Proc, Paragraphs, Macros, Scripts, Other.
3. Who's is it?
    - Third Party Software.
4. Do you have the source code and is it readable?
    - Is encryption/decryption part of the product?
    - Are some programs running, but have no source?
5. Licensing?
    - Do you have license to move the source?




## Data 

1. Where is it?
    - Single account or spread over multiple accounts.
2. How big is it?
    - Single tape or multiple tape or network transfer.




## Security / Users

1. What level of security do you want?
    1. Do you currently secure files at the O/S level?  (Usually only available on U2 type systems)
    2. Do you want to secure them?
2. Where are users based?
    - Do you have O/S level users or one single user entry point at that level?
    - Do you have multiple database users?  e.g. D3 Users
    - Does your application have its own users?




## Connectivity / Devices

1. How do your applications use connectivity?
    - Input/Output data via tcp ports?
    - remote data connections? (nfs/super-qpoint)
2. How do end-users and devices connect?
    - Terminal Telnet/SSH connections?
    - Printer connections?
    - Special Device?




## Transfer

1. How should you backup your existing system for initial transfer?
    - See Restoring data section for details on your platform/database
    - Consider the physical devices needed such as tape or disk space for backup files
    - Consider method for transfer of backup to new platform
2. How should you refresh this data during the migration process?
    - Can programs and other source items altered for migration be segregated?
    - How often will you be needing "refreshed" data?
3. How will you transfer for the LIVE jBASE conversion?
    - Consider amount of downtime needed for final transfer
    - Can some historical files be restored ahead of go-live?




## Prep the new server

1. Where will your jBASE source and data reside?
    - The jBASE installer will install jBASE and prerequisites for it
    - It is usually best to create a file system or drive specifically for the jBASE data
2. Review the Security/Users section and prep the new system to match
3. Be sure inter-machine connectivity and devices work with the new server
