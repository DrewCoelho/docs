Normally jkeyauto is run simply as "jkeyauto scriptname" but more options are available. The options available are


| Option<br> | Description<br> |
| --- | --- |
| -ftimeout<br> | Set the timeout value for Waiting on a sync. lock.<br> |
| -h or -?<br> | Display the help screen.<br> |
| -i<br> | ignore any extranous INPUT statements.<br> |
| -s<br> | Default to ignore any SLEEP statements in the script. This can subsequently be over-ridden by the SLEEP ON and SLEEP OFF statements within a script.<br> |
| -t<br> | Turn on statement tracing. Every time a new line of script begins execution, jkeyauto will display the source line. Useful for tracing and debugging large scripts. See also the TRACE ON and TRACE OFF statements.<br> |
| -x<br> | When jkeyauto exits, display to the terminal all the values of the variables created within the script.<br> |
| -S<br> | Manipulate the sync. lock<br> |


The -S option can also be used which changes the functionality of jkeyauto. When the -S option is used, then instead of executing the named script, we do the sync. functionality using jkeyauto scripts. This is similar to the SYNC statement described earlier. When the -S option is used, the syntax for the jkeyauto command becomes:

```
jkeyauto -S LOCK|UNLOCK|WAIT|TEST locknumber {-ftimeout}
```

See the description of the [SYNC](./../sync) statement for the operation of this syntax.
