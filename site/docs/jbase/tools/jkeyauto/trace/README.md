## Description

This allows you to trace the lines executed by jkeyauto. Can be useful when debugging very large scripts. You can also turn statement tracing on using the [-t option](./../options) to jkeyauto.

```
trace ON | OFF
```

An example of use may be as:

```
trace on
counter=1
again1:
PIPEREAD FOR 100 UNTIL "greg"
counter = counter+1
if counter LT 10 THEN goto again1
trace off
```

to have a loop of 10 iterations waiting for the application to send the "greg" string. Tracing is turned on at the start of the loop and off at the end, to check for errors in the script.
