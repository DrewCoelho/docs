## DescriptionÂ 

The CREATE-TRIGGER ( aka CREATE.TRIGGER ) command is used to specify the database events for which the trigger subroutine is called.

```
CREATE-TRIGGER -Options FileName {triggername|*} subroutine
```

where:

- FileName can reference either a jBASE hashed file or a directory.
- triggername must be **\*** or one of the nine database events: POSTOPEN, PREREAD, POSTREAD, PREWRITE, POSTWRITE, PREDELETE, POSTDELETE, PRECLEAR, POSTCLEAR. If **\*** is specified then the trigger **subroutine** will be called for each of the nine database events.
- options for CREATE-TRIGGER are:



| Option<br> | Name<br> | Explanation<br> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -a or (A)<br> | amend flag<br> | subroutine can amend the record<br> |
| -d or (D)<br> | debug flag<br> | subroutine can be debugged<br> |
| -t or (T)<br> | terminate flag<br> | subroutine terminates update<br> |
| -o or (O)<br> | overwrite flag<br> | overwrite any existing definitions<br> |


- subroutine is the name of a jBC subroutine.




## Note:


> CREATE-TRIGGER can be run multiple times for the same file. If a trigger has already been defined for the specified event then the overwrite flag must be used to effect the change.




### EXAMPLES

```
CREATE-TRIGGER BP POSTOPEN SUBBPOPEN
```

The subroutine SUBBPOPEN will be called immediately after the BP file is successfully opened by any jBASE process.

```
CREATE-TRIGGER -o PAYROLL * SUBBP
```

The subroutine SUBBP will be called for every database event to the PAYROLL file. Existing trigger definitions will be overwritten.
