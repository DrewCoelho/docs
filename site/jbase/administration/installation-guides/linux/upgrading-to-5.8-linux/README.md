<PageHeader />

Documenting an upgrade to jBASE 5.8 from a previous jBASE 5 version could cover many possibilities.

Our initial document will cover a scenario where a recent version of jBASE 5 (i.e. 5.7.0 or later) is installed, and we are installing jBASE as a Linux user with sudo privileges:

Use the space bar to page through the License Agreement and then accept:

We will opt for the Advanced install so that we have control over how jBASE 5.8 is installed:
