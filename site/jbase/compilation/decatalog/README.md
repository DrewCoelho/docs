# Decatalog

<PageHeader />

To remove released executables or subroutines, use the DECATALOG or the DELETE-CATALOG command.

```
DECATALOG FileName ProgramName
DELETE-CATALOG ProgramName    [UNIX/Linux only]
```

These command will remove an executable program from the "bin" directory or remove a subroutine from the shared library.
