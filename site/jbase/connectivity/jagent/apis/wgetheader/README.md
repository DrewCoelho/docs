The **WGETHEADER** subroutine allows you to retrieve sent headers.

## Command Syntax

```
CALL WGETHEADER(HEADERVALUE,HEADERNAME)
```

### Syntax Elements

The WGETHEADER subroutine expects HEADERNAME to be sent and will return HEADERVALUE if found.

### Example

```
CALL WGETHEADER(REQESTMETHOD,"REQUEST_METHOD")
```

### Notes

>The headers sent from the connector are determined by the connector config file. Â This is to protect from Header Injection attacks. If you need additional headers, refer to your connector config file and add the header.
>
>You can also get a list of supplied headers by calling WGETOPTIONS with a parameter of 34.
