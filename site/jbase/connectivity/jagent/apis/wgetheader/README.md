The WGETHEADER subroutine allows you to retrieve sent headers.

### **COMMAND SYNTAX**

```
CALL WGETHEADER(HEADERVALUE,HEADERNAME)
```

### **SYNTAX ELEMENTS**

The WSETCONTENTTYPE subroutine expects HEADERNAME to be sent and will return HEADERVALUE if found.

### **EXAMPLE**

```
CALL WGETHEADER(REQESTMETHOD,"REQUEST_METHOD")
```

### **NOTES**

The headers sent from the connector are determined by the connector config file. Â This is to protect from Header Injection attacks. If you need additional headers refer to your connector config file and add the header.

You can also get a list of supplied headers by calling WGETOPTIONS and passing 34.
