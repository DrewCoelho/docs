## Description

Concatenates fields, literals, and the results of a previous operation. It takes the general form:

```
C{;}n{xn}...
```

where:

- **;** is optional. It has no function other than to provide compatibility.
- **n** can be one of the following:
  - a field number (FMC)
  - a literal enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or backslashes
  - an asterisk (\*) to specify the last generated value of a previous operation.
- **x** is the character to be inserted between the concatenated elements. If you specify a semicolon ( ; ), no separator will be used. Any non-numeric character except a system delimiters (value, subvalue, field, start buffer, and segment marks) is valid.

### Input Conversion

Input conversion does not invert. The concatenation is applied to the input data.

### Examples

```
C1;2
```

Concatenates the contents of field 1 with field 2, with no intervening separator character.

```
C1*2
```

Concatenates the contents of field 1 with an asterisk (\*) and then the content of field 2.

```
C1*"ABC" 2/3
```

Concatenates the contents of field 1 with an asterisk (\*), the string ABC, a space, field 2 a forward slash (/) and then field 3.

See the descriptions of the function codes (A, F, FS and their variants) for other concatenation methods.
