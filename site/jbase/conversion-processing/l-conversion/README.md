## Description

L codes return the length of a value, or the value if it is within specified criteria. They take the general form:

```
L{{min,}max}
```

where:

- **min** specifies that the process is to return an element if its length is greater than or equal to the number **min**.
- **max** specifies that the process is to return an element if its length is less than or equal to the number **max**.

### Not

> The L code by itself returns the length of an element.
>
> When used with **max**, or **min** and **max**, the L code returns the element if it is within the length specified by **min** and/or **max**.

### Example 1

```
L
```

Assuming a value of ABCDEF, returns the value 6.

### Example 2

```
L4
```

If JBCEMULATE is set to ROS, L4 is translated as return the value if its length is less than or equal to 4 - the equivalent of L0,4. Assuming a value of ABCDEF, L4 will return null - the value is longer than 4 characters.

If JBCEMULATE is not set to ROS, L4 is translated as return the value if its length is exactly equal to 4 - the equivalent of L4,4. Assuming a value of ABCDEF, L4 will return null - the value is longer than 4 characters.

### Example 3

```
L4,7
```

L4,7 is translated as return the value if its length is greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 7. Assuming a value of ABCDEF, L4,7 will return ABCDEF
