The ED editor provided with jBASE is a limited version of the familiar (but now superseded) ED editors

Users are strongly advised to use the [jED](325732-jed) editor in preference to ED - so strongly that no operating instructions are included here for the ED editor.

If the user is only familiar with the old style ED editor, by all means continue to use it in the accustomed fashion - but please find a few minutes to review the operation of jED. The transition from ED to jED is very simple with the reward being adopting the much more efficient and friendly environment provided by jED.
