# Emulation (revised)

<PageHeader />

## Description

Emulation support is provided by the `Config_EMULATE` file in the `config` sub directory of the jBASE release directory. All text in the file is case insensitive.

The format of that file is:

- `#` Denotes a comment and the line is ignored.
- `x:` Denotes a label, signifying the start of an emulation definition.
- `any` Denotes an emulation definition.

Labels must be alpha-numeric, i.e. no periods, underlines, etc. If one label directly follows another then the label is synonym for the same emulation definition. The emulation definition ends when another label or the end of file encountered.

Multiple emulation definitions can be defined on the same line with each definition delimited by a comma or a semicolon. Emulation definitions can be interrupted by blank lines and can contain any amount of white space, i.e. one or more spaces or tab characters.

Emulation definitions can be declared 'on', 'yes' or 'true' to mean the emulation is enabled or similarly use the strings 'off', 'no' or 'false' to mean the emulation effect is disabled.

To use a different set of emulation definitions from the default set, set the environment variable `JBCEMULATE` in your current environment to the required emulation label. When the environment variable is not configured then the emulation definition defined by the default label is in effect. If the default label is not present then the first label detected will be used for the default emulation.

Generally any emulation definitions which affect BASIC, (like the @(-n) codes), use the `JBCEMULATE` environment variable when the programs are compiled, whereas the other definitions tend to be used at runtime, when the program is executed.

You can create your own custom emulation sections in the `Config_EMULATE` file but it is recommended to use Alternate Emulations for this purpose.

## Alternate Emulations

An Alternate Emulation has the general form:

```
Config_EMULATE_name
```

where `name` is the name of the emulation. These emulations are also stored in the `config` directory under `$JBCRELEASEDIR`. and follow the exact same rules. The file name of the alternate emulation must be the same as the `label`, i.e. the `x:` line.

Alternate Emulations can contain any combination of configuration options except `dup` entries. If you require the behavior of a `dup` entry then all configuration settings in that section must be explicitly added to the Alternate Emulation.

For example, to create an alternate `jbase` emulation called `jcustom`, which changes the value of the `old_jql_output_style` setting, would be:

```
File name: Config_EMULATE_jcustom

jcustom:
      @(-1) = clear_screen ; @(-2) = cursor_home ; @(-3) = clear_eos ; @(-4) = clear_eol
      @(-5) = blink_on ; @(-6) = blink_off
      @(-7) = prot_on ; @(-8) = prot_off ;
      @(-9) = cursor_left ; @(-10) = cursor_up ; @(-20) = cursor_down ; @(-19) = cursor_right
      @(-13) = reverse_on ; @(-14) = reverse_off
      @(-15) = underline_on ; @(-16) = underline_off
      @(-17) = printer_on ; @(-18) = printer_off
      @(-33) = background white ; @(-34) = background yellow ; @(-35) = background magenta ; @(-36) = background red
      @(-37) = background cyan ; @(-38) = background green ; @(-39) = background blue ; @(-40) = background black
      @(-41) = foreground white ; @(-42) = foreground yellow ; @(-43) = foreground magenta ; @(-44) = foreground red
      @(-45) = foreground cyan ; @(-46) = foreground green ; @(-47) = foreground blue ; @(-48) = foreground black
      @(-57) = foreground white ; @(-58) = foreground yellow ; @(-59) = foreground magenta ; @(-60) = foreground red
      @(-61) = foreground cyan ; @(-62) = foreground green ; @(-63) = foreground blue ; @(-64) = foreground black
      @(-200) = cursor_on , @(-201) = cursor_off
      list_keys = true
      reality_video = true
      jbase_field = true
      named_common = null
      readv0 = key
      treat_with_as_or_with = true
      dates_upper_case = yes
      use_sql_syntax_for_select = false
      old_jql_output_style = true
      itype_trans_replace_delim = false
      itype_unquoted_numeric_literal = true
      enter_keeps_common_data = false
      error_numbers_are_single_attribute = false
```

To use this definition, set the `JBCEMULATE` environment variable to `jcustom`, e.g.

```
export JBCEMULATE=jcustom   [Linux]
set JBCEMULATE=jcustom      [Windows]
```

Note that you can't use the `dup` option with alternate emulations. In other words, you can't do something like this:

```
jcustom:
      dup = jbase
      old_jql_output_style = true
```

The entries must be expanded explicitly.

## Example #1

(conv_old_mct = true|false)

```
string = 'Bas-e'
OCONV(string, 'MCT')
```

The resulting string is "BASE"

## Example #2

(no_extra_delimiter = true|false)

This behaviour is true for all of:

```
dyn_array<-1> = whatever ,
x = INSERT( dyn_array,-1,.., ..; whatever )
```

and

```
INS whatever BEFORE dyn_array<-1,..,...>
```

## Example #3

```
Program:
DATA 'input1'
EXECUTE 'paragraph'

PA
SELECT file
C 'input1' will NOT be passed to the above 'SELECT' if 'para_stacked_data = true'
<<'GetInput'>>
C 'GetInput' above will be satisfied by 'input1' if 'para_stacked_data = true'
```

## Example #4

```
HSELECT <--- The trailing 'space' has been omitted within the Proc
IP
A'

```

## Example #5

```
SELECT 'input_data'

rather than:

SELECT'input_data'
```

## Example #6

```
READV variablename FROM filevariable ,'my_record', 0  ELSE ABORT 202,'my_record'

```

## Example #7

```
List MD WITH *A1 't' WITH *A2'115'
```

will be evaluated the same as:

```
List MD WITH *A1 't' AND WITH *A2'115'
```

## Example #8

The query:

```
List MD WITH *A1 't' WITH *A2'115'

```

will be evaluated the same as:

```
List MD WITH *A1 't' OR WITH *A2'115'

```

## Note

> Some of the "generic" emulation behavior will change at run-time, but for a **complete** change, the code should be recompiled.
>
> Despite being set at Run-time, if running from jshell, requires that a new jshell be invoked before the behavior will change.

On many platforms, @(-n) codes are used to control special terminal characteristics. However the definition of these codes differs between platforms. Rather than "hard coding" the @(-n) codes, jBASE allows their definition in the `Config_EMULATE` file. This allows legacy applications to use existing @(-n) codes and so reduces the time required to port an application to jBASE.  
A knowledge of [terminfo capabilities](./../environment-variables/terminfo/README.md) can be useful when defining these codes.
