# Introduction to Environment Variables

<PageHeader />

## Setting/Getting

## Windows

```
set variable=value
echo %variable%
```

Variables can be configured in the System environment for all users, and/or on a per user basis via the user environment. Additional variables for jBASE can also be added to the current user configuration in the Windows registry.

Windows variables are usually configured in the System Properties panel.

## UNIX

```bash
export variable=value
echo $variable
```

This works for all shells, although some shells (i.e. ksh) allow "export variable=value".

Variables are usually configured in the .profile/.bash\_profile of the user login directory. Â Global variables can be added to the "/etc/profile" script.

## jBASE Programs

The jBC functions **PUTENV()** and **GETENV()** can be used to manipulate environment variables. For example:

```
ok = PUTENV(envar=x)
ok = GETENV(envar)
```

## jBASE Initialization

Some environment variables can only be set before jBASE initialization. jBASE initialization occurs when the first jBASE program is executed on a particular **PORT** number.

The jBASE initialization process reads through the environment entries looking for possible variables required by jBASE. This process provides a substantial performance improvement as the state of these environment variables are saved for subsequent jBASE executions. These states continue to be valid as long as the **PORT** number is still attached to a process. Some environment variables can be changed by subsequent program execution. The state of these variables are imported back into the state table after program execution.

Certain jBASE programs expect jBASE initialization to have been previously performed otherwise re-initialization will occur and resources expected by the executing program will have been removed.

For instance:

**T-ATT** requires a **PORT** number against which it saves the tape device assignment.
**SP-ASSIGN** requires a "PORT" with which to save assignment status for print jobs.
**READNEXT** in a program after **SELECT**/**GET-LIST**.

All jBASE programs execute in the same process unless explicitly executed via the **@IM****:"k"** construct.
