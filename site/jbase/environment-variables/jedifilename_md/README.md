## Description

This variable should be used if you require the use of a MD or VOC file to hold Q pointers, jCL programs, paragraphs or entries for jQL (jBASE Query Language). If you have loaded an account-save into your home directory then you might wish to set this variable. This will then allow you to:

- Execute jCL programs and paragraphs directly from the MD/VOC (using **jsh** or EXECUTE/CHAIN etc.)
- Support Q-pointers and F-pointers in the MD/VOC file (may need [**JEDIFILENAME\_SYSTEM**](./../jedifilename_system))
- On systems with 14 char filename limits, create cross reference items for executables from the original name to the new name.

## Values

Valid file path. Â While it is not required, it is strongly advised that this value be set to the complete path of the MD and not a relative path (as an example, **/home/MD]D** should be used instead of **./MD]D**).

## Default

None

## Setting

As per normal environment variable, so it can be set at any time by the commands:

## UNIX

```
export JEDIFILENAME_MD=/usr/GLOBAL/MD]D
```

## Windows

```
set JEDIFILENAME_MD=D:\GLOBAL\MD]D
```
