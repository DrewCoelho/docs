# Backing up jBASE Servers using Veeam

## Introduction

The Veeam utility can be used to make full or partial backups of Windows and Linux jBASE servers.

In order that an uncorrupted copy of the jBASE folders is made, a DB-PAUSE should be in effect before the backup is made.

After the backup, a DB-RESUME should be issued to allow normal jBASE activity to resume.
