# Configuring the full backup of a Linux jBASE server

<PageHeader />

From the Veeam console, select "Home -> Backup Job -> Linux Computer -> New Linux Computer Backup":

![Linux_Backup_1](./full_linux_backup_1.png)

For the New Agent Backup Job, select "Job Mode -> Server -> Managed by backup server":

![Linux_Backup_2](./full_linux_backup_2.png)

Assign a meaningful name:

![Linux_Backup_3](./full_linux_backup_3.png)

Add details of the computer system to be backed-up via "Add -> Individual Computer":

![Linux_Backup_4](./full_linux_backup_4.png)

Add Linux account or Linux private key credentials:

![Linux_Backup_5](./full_linux_backup_5.png)

Typical Linux account credential set-up where the user is already a member of "sudoers":

![Linux_Backup_6](./full_linux_backup_6.png)

You can also generate a private key using "puttygen", the freeware [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) private key generator, which then needs to be copied to the Windows file system for access:

![Linux_Backup_7](./full_linux_backup_7.png)

In the above case, the "zumasys" user is already a member of the "sudoers" group.

At the moment, however, the private key requirements for Veeam do not seem to be "in-sync" with the type and strength of key generated by the latest version of "puttygen"

Set the Backup Mode:

![Linux_Backup_8](./full_linux_backup_8.png)

Select a storage location with adequate space to store these full backups:

![Linux_Backup_9](./full_linux_backup_9.png)

Select any Guest Processing that needs to be done in order to facilitate restores:

![Linux_Backup_10](./full_linux_backup_10.png)

and enable guest file system indexing for the folders where the jBASE accounts reside:

![Linux_Backup_11](./full_linux_backup_11.png)

Set a schedule for when the backups should be run:

![Linux_Backup_12](./full_linux_backup_12.png)

And then "Apply":

![Linux_Backup_13](./full_linux_backup_13.png)

The completed job:

![Linux_Backup_14](./full_linux_backup_14.png)

Remember to set "crontab" to run a DB-PAUSE before the backup is due to start:

![Linux_Backup_15](./Linux_crontab.png)

## Note

> When performing Linux backups, it is possible to encounter connectivity errors such as "No character device registered for veeamsnap kernel module."
> This [Veeam Community Forum URL](https://forums.veeam.com/veeam-agent-for-linux-f41/no-character-device-registered-for-veeamsnap-kernel-module-t62256.html) provided some useful pointers as to a set of RPM's which could be downloaded and, via the Veeam application, installed on the Linux system.
