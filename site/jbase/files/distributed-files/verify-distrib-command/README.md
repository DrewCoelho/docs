# VERIFY-DISTRIB Command

<PageHeader />

The **VERIFY-DISTRIB** command verifies the existence of the component part files of a distributed file. If the distributed file uses the user-defined partition method, **VERIFY-DISTRIB** also verifies that the subroutine is executable. It takes the general form:

```
VERIFY-DISTRIB FileName
```

Where **FileName** is the name of a Distributed File.

An example of use would be as:

```
VERIFY-DISTRIB INVENTORY
```
