## Description 

The **jrf**utility provides automated facilities to resize and convert from one Hash file type to another. In order to resize the file enough disk space must be available to create a second temporary version of the file, as the resize process creates a temporary file and then copies the data from the original file to the temporary file. Once copied, the temporary file is renamed to the original file.

### Syntax:

```
jrf {-options} {{DICT} filename1 {{DICT} filename2 ...}}
jrf {-options} *
```




| Option<br> | Explanation<br> |
| --- | --- |
| \*<br> | Process all files in the current director (ignored if a list of files or a preceding select-list is supplied).<br> |
| **-H3**<br> | Force to HASH3 file type.<br> |
| **-H4**<br> | Force to HASH4 file type.<br> |
| **-H5**<br> | Force to HASHP (jPlus) file type.<br> |
| **-H7**<br> | Force to HASHD (Dynamic) file type (*default if no other file type is specified*).<br> |
| **-C**<br> | Only the restore specification will be set, so that the file is resized automatically when the file is restored. To resize files to a lower modulo requires that the 'D' option also be invoked along with the 'C' option.<br> |
| **-D**<br> | Allow downsize of file.<br> |
| **-E**<br> | Resize empty files.<br> |
| **-I**<br> | Ignore (do not process) empty files.<br> |
| **-L**<br> | Do not transaction log the temporary file created during process.<br> |
| **-Mn**<br> | Allow the hash method to be overridden when resizing the file. In normal operation the default hash method for the file should be used, however the -M option allows experimentation with different hash methods, which may have a small benefit dependent upon the nature of the record key, 'n' specifies the hash method, 4 3,4,5 or 7.<br> |
| **-N**<br> | Decrypt the file. This option has no effect if the file is already decrypted.<br> |
| **-O**<br> | Encrypt (Obfuscate) the file. This option has no effect if the file is already encrypted.<br> |
| **-R**<br> | Reporting only (do not actually resize). Display the suggested resize parameters.<br> |
| **-V**<br> | Verbose mode<br> |
| **-V1**<br> | Very verbose mode<br> |
| **-Sm{,s{,i}}**<br> | Size to parameters<br>    m = modulo, s = separation, i = in group maximum size<br> |
| **-h** | **-?**<br> | Display syntax and options<br> |


***\*\*\*Invalid options are ignored\*\*\****

### Notes:

- A preceding select-list of file names can be supplied to the **jrf** command.
- If it becomes necessary to resize a file specified by the **JEDIFILENAME\_MD** environment variable then you must unset **JEDIFILENAME\_MD** prior to resizing. The same holds true for the **JEDIFILENAME\_SYSTEM** environment variable.
- The temporary file used during the resize operation is created in the directory that the **jrf**command is run from. Therefore, a file cannot be resized via Q-pointer, F-pointer or **JEDIFILEPATH**access. You must **cd**to the directory where the file exists or specify the full path to the file.
- WARNING: The **jrf**utility should ONLY be executed when users are NOT connected to the database otherwise data loss can occur. In other words, the file should not be opened by another process.
