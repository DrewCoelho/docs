## Description 

The **RENAME-FILE**command allows the user to rename a file, its dictionary and its associated control file**\*** with a single command.

The command takes the general form:

```
RENAME-FILE filename
```

where filename is the name the file to be renamed. The file type must be one of the supported jBASE [file types](./../create-file).

**\*** A control file is the file ending in **]I**and is created when an index or trigger is created on the main file. Thus, the name of the control file will be the **filename]I**where **filename** is the name of the file.

## Note: 


> RENAME-FILE doesn't require a '(' when specifying the destination file name.  The destination file name must not exist or the rename will fail.
> 
> RENAME-FILE assumes that the dictionary section of the specified file exists. The command will fail if it cannot open the dictionary section. It will rename the data section *and* the dictionary section. If you only want to move the data or dictionary portion of a file, use jmv.
> 
> RENAME-FILE calls an internal function to perform the rename. If transaction journaling is active, the rename is logged as a MOVEFILE transaction.
> 
> RENAME-FILE does not work on files that contain operating system meta-characters (e.g. "SALES\*MAR").




### EXAMPLES

An example of use may be as:

Renames the file **File1**, its dictionary and its control file to **New.File1**
