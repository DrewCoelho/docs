## Introduction

jBASE 5 incorporates modifications to the underlying jBASE library functions and components to provide the tools and mechanisms whereby global communities can internationalize and localize applications. The internationalization functionality provides applications with the capability for correct handling of locale dependent collation sequencing, along with processing of unique character properties, code page data import/export and terminal/printer data input and output. The jBASE library functions, when used in International Mode, process internally using character rather than byte orientated values and properties such that applications can be easily coded or converted with minimum change for the international market.
