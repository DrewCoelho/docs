# CLEAR

<PageHeader /> 

## Description

The **CLEAR** statement will initialize all the variables to numeric 0. This can be used at any time in the execution of a program. It takes the general form:

```
CLEAR
```

As can be noted below:

```
Var1 = 99
Var2 = 50
CLEAR
```

The above code will clear the variables to zero.

This does not affect COM{MON} unless the `clear_will_clear_common` configuration option is set.
