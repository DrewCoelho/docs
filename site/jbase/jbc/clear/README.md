# CLEAR

<PageHeader /> 

## Description

The **CLEAR** statement will initialize all the variables to numeric 0. This can be used at any time in the execution of a program. It takes the general form:

```
CLEAR
```

As can be noted below:

```
Var1 = 99
Var2 = 50
CLEAR
```

The above code will clear the variables to zero

Note this does not affect COM{MON}. See [CLEARCOMMON](./../clearcommon "jBC CLEARCOMMON")
