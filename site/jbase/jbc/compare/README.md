## Description

The **COMPARE** function compares two strings and returns a value indicating whether or not they are equal. The function takes the form:

```
COMPARE (expression1, expression2 {, justification})
```

Where:

- **expression1** is the first string for comparison
- **expression2** is the second string for comparison
- **justification** specifies how the strings are to be compared.
  - "L" indicates a left justified comparison.
  - "R" indicates a right justified comparison.

The default is left justification.

The function returns one of the following values:

- -1 The first string is less than the second
- 0 The strings are equal
- 1 The first string is greater than the second

An example of use would be as:

```
     A = "XY999"
     B = "XY1000"
     R1 = COMPARE(A,B,"L")
     R2 = COMPARE(A,B,"R")
     CRT R1,R2
```

The code above displays 1 -1, which indicates that XY999 is greater than XY1000 in a left justified comparison and XY999 is less than XY1000 in a right justified comparison.
