## Description

This function decrypts strings. It takes the general form:

```
DECRYPT(string, key, method)
```

Where:

- **string** specifies the string to be encrypted.
- **key** is the value used to encrypt the string. Its use depends on method.
- **method** is a value which indicates the encryption mechanism to.

The ENCRYPT and DECRYPT functions that are part of jBASE BASIC  now support the following  cipher methods (Defined in JBC.h)

- JBASE\_CRYPT\_GENERAL General-purpose encryption scheme
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_AES algorithm (AES256)
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_AES\_BASE64 algorithm (AES256, BASE64 encoded)
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_ROT13 Simple ROT13 algorithm. (Key not used)
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_XOR11 XOR MOD11 algorithm. Uses the first character of a key as a seed value.
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_RC2 RC2 algorithm
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_DES DES algorithm
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_3DES Three Key, Triple DES algorithm
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_BLOWFISH Blowfish algorithm
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_BASE64 (See below)

BASE64 is not really an encryption method, but more of an encoding. The reason for this is that the output of an encryption often results in a binary string. It allows binary data to be represented as a character string. BASE64 operation is not required but is performed in addition to the primary algorithm. e.g. JBASE\_CRYPT\_RC2\_BASE64

ENCRYPT with this method is the same as a DECRYPT with method JBASE\_CRYPT\_RC2 followed by DECRYPT with method JBASE\_CRYPT\_BASE64.

DECRYPT with this method is the same as a DECRYPT with method JBASE\_CRYPT\_BASE64 followed by DECRYPT with method JBASE\_CRYPT\_RC2.

- JBASE\_CRYPT\_RC2\_BASE64 RC2 algorithm
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_DES\_BASE64 DES algorithm
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_3DES\_BASE64 Triple DES algorithm
- JBASE\_CRYPT\_BLOWFISH \_BASE64 Blowfish algorithm.

An example of use may be as follows:

```
INCLUDE JBC.h
cipher = JBASE_CRYPT_BLOWFISH_BASE64
key = "Thunderbirds 2086"
str = "This is the string to be encrypted"
enc = ENCRYPT( str, key, cipher )
CRT "Encrypted:" :enc
dec = DECRYPT( enc, key, cipher )
CRT "Decrypted: ":dec
```

The above will display as output:

```
Encrypted:bjrngdlVNjSsY6iUVhn8pA9WD2cYo7HB8at0QhwvjvApc8Gih8PQ/A==
Decrypted: This is the string to be encrypted
```
