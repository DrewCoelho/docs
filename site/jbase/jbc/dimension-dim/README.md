# DIMENSION (DIM)

## Description

The **DIM** statement is used to declare arrays to the compiler before referencing.

```
DIM{ENSION} variable(number{, number, ... }){, variable(number {,number, ...}) ...}
```

Where:

- **variable**Â may be any valid variable name neither declared nor previously used.
- **numbers** defines the size of each dimension and must be either constants or the subject of an [EQUATE](./../equate) statement.

A single **DIM** statement may declare a number of arrays by separating their declarations with a comma.

## Note

> - The array must be declared before it is referenced in the program source (compilation as opposed to execution). If using a variable as an undeclared dimensioned array the compiler will display an error message.
> - The array variable must be used as a normal variable or dynamic array before dimensioning, as the compiler will detect this as an error.
> - Dimensioning to a variable requires **resize\_array = true** to be set as a configuration option in the **$JBCRELEASEDIR/config/Config\_EMULATE** file.
> - When arrays are referenced directly as in A = Array(7), the compiler will optimize the reference as if it was a single undimensioned variable.

The statements in the code snippet below show how arrays can be declared.

```
EQUATE DimSize1 TO 29
DIM Array1(10,10), Array2(5, 20, 5, 8)
DIM Age(DimSize1)
```
