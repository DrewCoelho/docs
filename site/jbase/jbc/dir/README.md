## Description

The **DIR()** function is used to return information about a file. It takes the general form:

```
DIR(filename)
```

Where **filename** is a string argument representing the relative or absolute path of a file or directory. This function returns a dynamic array with four attributes.

| Attribute | Â Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | File size in bytes |
| 2 | last modified date (in internal format) |
| 3 | last modified time (in internal format) |
| 4 | **D** if the filename is a directory, **null** otherwise |

An example of use is as follows:

```
    info = DIR(".")

    CRT "DIR info returned is : " : OCONV(info, "MCP")
```

to assign file information to variable **info**, which can then be interrogated.

An example of the results provided is as follows:

```
DIR info returned is : 4096^19087^60171^D
```
