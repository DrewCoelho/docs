## Description

The **FIND** statement allows the location of a specified string within a dynamic array. It takes the general form:

```
FIND expression1 IN Var1 {, expression2} SETTING Var2 {, Var3 {, Var4}} THEN | ELSE statement(s)
```

Where:

- **expression1** evaluates to the string with which to compare every element of the dynamic array.
- **Var1** is the dynamic array that will be searched.

The **FIND** command will normally find the first occurrence of **expression1**, unless **expression2** is specified. If specified, then **expression2** will cause a specific occurrence of **expression1** to be located. The three variables **Var2**, **Var3**, **Var4** are used to record the Field, Value and Sub-Value positions in which **expression1** was found.

If **expression1** is found in any element of **Var1** then **Vars** **2, 3** and **4** are set to the position in which it was found and any **THEN** clause of the statement is executed. If **expression1** is not found within any element of the dynamic array then **Vars** **2, 3** and **4** are undefined and the **ELSE** clause of the statement is executed.

## Note

> The statement may omit either the **THEN** clause or the **ELSE** clause but may not omit both. It is valid for the statement to contain both clauses if required.

An example of use is as:

```
v.Array = 'ABC' : @FM : 'DEF' : @VM : 'XYZ' : @SM : 'XYZ'

FIND 'XYZ' IN v.Array SETTING v.Fld, v.Val THEN
    CRT "XYZ is in field: " : v.Fld, "value: ": v.Val
END ELSE
    CRT "Not found"
END
```

to display:

```
XYZ is in field: 2      value: 2
```
