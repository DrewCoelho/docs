## Description

Writes all the buffers for a sequential I/O file immediately. Normally, sequential I/O uses buffering for input/output operations, and writes are not immediately flushed. It takes the general form:

```
FLUSH file.variable {THEN statements [ELSE statements] | ELSE statements}
```

Where:

**file variable**Â specifies a file previously opened for sequential processing. If **file.variable** evaluates to null, the **FLUSH** statement fails and the program enters the debugger. After the buffer is written to the file, it executes the THEN statements, ignoring the ELSE statements.

If none of the above can be completed, it executes the ELSE statements.

An example of use is as:

```
OPENSEQ 'TEST-ENV', 'records_2' TO FILE THEN
   PRINT "'TEST-ENV' OPENED FOR SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING"
END ELSE STOP
WEOFSEQ FILE
WRITESEQ 'This is a new entry' ON FILE THEN
    FLUSH FILE THEN
        PRINT "BUFFER FLUSHED"
    END ELSE PRINT "NOT FLUSHED"
    ELSE ABORT

    CLOSESEQ FILE
END
```
