# GETLIST

<PageHeader />

## Description

**GETLIST** allows the program to retrieve a previously stored list (perhaps created with the **SAVE-LIST** command), into a variable. It takes the general form:

```
GETLIST expression TO variable1 {SETTING variable2} THEN|ELSE statements
```

Where:

- **variable1** is the variable into which the list will be read.
- **expression** should evaluate to the name of a previously stored list to retrieve, or null. If **expression** evaluates to null, the current default external select list (generated by a previous [SELECT](./../select) command for example) will be retrieved.
- If specified, **variable2** will be set to the number of elements in the list.
- If the statement succeeds in retrieving the list, then the statements associated with any **THEN** clause will be executed. If the statement fails to find the list, then the statements associated with any **ELSE** clause will be executed.

The **GETLIST** statement is identical in function to the [READLIST](./../readlist) statement.

An example of use is as:

```
GETLIST "MyList" TO MyList ELSE STOP
* Loop until there are no more elements
LOOP WHILE READNEXT Key FROM MyList DO
......
REPEAT
```
