## Description

The **ICONV()** function converts data in external form such as dates to their internal form. The function takes the general form:

```
ICONV(expression1, expression2)
```

Where:

- **expression1** evaluates to the data upon which the conversion is to be performed.
- **expression2** should evaluate to the conversion code that is to be performed against the data.

[comment]: <> ( Add additional **ICONV** extensions for timestamp as per WDx/WTx )

If the conversion code used assumes a numeric value and a non-numeric value is passed then the original value in **expression1** is returned unless the emulation option iconv\_nonnumeric\_return\_null is set.

An example of use is as:

```
InternalDate = ICONV("27 MAY 1997", "D")
CRT InternalDate
```

The above should display the date in internal format.
