## Description

The **INPUTNULL** statement allows the definition of a character that will allow a null input to be seen by the [INPUT@](./../input) statement. It takes the general form:

```
INPUTNULL expression
```

Where **expression**Â should evaluate to a single character. Subsequently, any [INPUT@](./../input) statement that sees only this character input before the new-line sequence will NULL the variable in which input is being stored.

If expression evaluates to the empty string '' then the default character of '\_' is used to define a NULL input sequence.

## Note

> The [INPUT](./../input) statement does not default to accepting the '\_' character as a NULL input.

An example of use is as:

```
INPUTNULL "&"
INPUT @(10,10):Answer,1
IF Answer = "" THEN
    CRT "A NULL input was received"
END
```
