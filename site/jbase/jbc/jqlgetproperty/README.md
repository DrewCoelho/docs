## Description

Gets the property of a compiled jQL statement. It takes the general form:

```
JQLGETPROPERTY(PropertyValue, Statement, Column, PropertyName)
```

Where:

- **PropertyValue** Receives the requested property value from the system or “” if the property is not set 
- **Statement** The result of a valid [JQLCOMPILE(Statement)](./../jqlcompile)
- **Column** Specifies that you want the value of the property for a specific column (otherwise 0 for the whole statement).
- **PropertyName** These are EQUATED values defined by INCLUDE’ing the file JQLINTERFACE.h.

This function returns -1 if there is a problem with the parameters or the program. These properties answer questions such as “Was LPTR mode asked for,” and “How many columns are there?”

## Note

> Properties are valid after the compile; this is the main reason for separating the compile and execute into two functions. After compiling, it is possible to examine the properties and set properties before executing.
