# KEYIN

<PageHeader />

## Description

Use the **KEYIN** function to read a single character from the input buffer and return it. The function takes the general form:

```
KEYIN
```

**KEYIN** uses raw keyboard input, therefore all special character handling (for example, backspace) is disabled. System special character handling (for example, processing of interrupts) is unchanged.
