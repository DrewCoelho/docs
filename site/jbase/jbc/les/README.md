## Description

The **LES** function is used to determine whether elements of one dynamic array are less than or equal to the elements of another dynamic array.

```
LES(array1, array2)
```

In operation, the function compares each element of **array1** with the corresponding element of **array2**. If the element from **array1** is less than or equal to the element from **array2**, a one (1) is returned in the corresponding element of a new dynamic array. If the element from **array1** is greater than the element from **array2**, it returns a zero (0).

If an element of one dynamic array has no corresponding element in the other dynamic array, it evaluates the undefined element as empty, and the comparison continues.

If either of a corresponding pair of elements is null, it returns null for that element.

An example of use is as:

```
VAL =" "
FOR I = 1 TO 3
    INS I BEFORE VAL<1>
NEXT I

VAL2 =" "
FOR I = 2 TO 4
    INS I*3 BEFORE VAL2<-3>
NEXT I

CRT VAL
CRT VAL2
CRT (LES(VAL, VAL2))
```
