# NULL

<PageHeader />  

## Description

The **NULL** statement performs no function but can be useful in clarifying syntax and where the language requires a statement but the programmer does not wish to perform any actions. It takes the general form:

```
NULL
```

An example is as:

```
LOCATE strA IN strB SETTING varC ELSE NULL
```
