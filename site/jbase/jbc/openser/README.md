# OPENSER

<PageHeader />  

## Description

The **OPENSER** statement is used to handle Serial IO. Serial IO to the COM ports on NT and to device files, achieves this on UNIX by Â using the sequential file statements. In addition, certain control operations can be performed using the [IOCTL function](./../ioctl). The **OPENSER** function takes the general form:

```
OPENSER Path,DevInfo| PIPE TO FileVar THEN | ELSE Statements
```

Where :

**Path** is the pathname of the required device.

**DevInfo** consists of the following:

| Baud |  | Baud rate required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flow | y | X-ON X-OFF flow control (default) |
|  | n | no flow control |
|  | i | input flow contro |
|  | o | output flow control |
| Parity | e | 7 bit even parity |
|  | o | 7 bit odd parity |
|  | n | 8 bit no parity (default) |
|  | s | 8 bit no parity, strip top bit |
| Pipe |  | specifies the file is to be opened to a Pipe for reading. |

## Note

> The **PIPE** functionality allows a process to open a **PIPE**, once opened then the process can execute a command via the [WRITESEQ](./../writeseq)/[SEND](./../send) statement and then received the result back via the [GET](./../get)/[READSEQ](./../readseq) statements.

An example of use is as:

```
FileName = "/dev/tty01s"
OPENSER FileName TO File ELSE STOP 201,FileName
WRITESEQ "ls -ail" ON File,"" ;* ONLY for PIPEs
LOOP
    Terminator = CHAR (10)
    WaitTime = 4
    GET Input
    WAITING WaitTime THEN
        CRT "Get Ok, Input ":Input:" Count ":Count:"TermChar":TermChar
    END ELSE
        CRT "Get Timed out Input ":Input:" Count ":Count:" TermChar":TermChar
    END
WHILE Input NE "" DO
REPEAT
```
