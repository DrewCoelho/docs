## Description

The **OSBREAD** command reads data from a file starting at a specified byte location for a certain length of bytes, and assigns the data to a variable. It takes the general form:

```
OSBREAD var FROM file.var [AT byte.expr] LENGTH length.expr [ON ERROR statements]
```

Where:

- **var** specifies a variable to which to assign the data read,
- FROM **file.var** specifies a file from which to read the data,
- AT **byte.expr** specifies a location in the file from which to begin reading data. If **byte.expr** is 0, the read begins at the beginning of the file,
- LENGTH **length.expr** specifies a length of data to read from the file, starting at **byte.expr**. **length.expr** cannot be longer than the maximum string length determined by system configuration,
- ON ERROR **statements** specifies statements to execute if a fatal error occurs (if the file is not open, or if the file is a read-only file). If the **ON ERROR** clause is not specified, the program terminates under such fatal error conditions.

## Note

> - Before using **OSBREAD**, a file must be opened using the [OSOPEN](./../osopen) or [OPENSEQ](./../openseq) command.
> - The ASCII 0 character [CHAR (0)] is used as a string-end delimiter. Therefore, ASCII 0 cannot be used in any string variable within jBASE. **OSBREAD** converts CHAR(0) to CHAR(128) when reading a block of data.
> - After execution of **OSBREAD**, the [STATUS](./../status-function) function returns either 0 or a failure code.
> - **OSBREAD** performs an operating system block read on a UNIX or Windows file.

An example of use is a program statement that reads 10,000 bytes of the file MYPIPE starting from the beginning of the file. The program assigns the data it reads to the variable Data.

```
OSBREAD Data FROM MYPIPE AT 0 LENGTH 10000
```
