## Description

The **OSOPEN** command opens a sequential file that does not use CHAR(10) as the line delimiter. The command takes the general form:

```
OSOPEN filename TO file.var [ON ERROR statements] {THEN | ELSE} statements [END]
```

Where:

- **filename** specifies the file to open. **filename** must include the complete path name unless the file resides in the current directory,
- TO **file.var** Specifies a variable to contain a pointer to the file,
- ON ERROR **statements** specifies statements to execute if the **OSOPEN** statement fails with a fatal error because the file is not open, an I/O error occurs, or jBASE cannot find the file. If you do not specify the **ON ERROR** clause and a fatal error occurs, the program enters the debugger.

**THEN** statements Execute if the read is successful.

**ELSE** statements Execute if the read is not successful or the record (or ID) does not exist.

## Note

> Read/write access mode is the default. Omitting READONLY and WRITEONLY will by default specify this access mode.
>
> After opening a sequential file with **OSOPEN**, use [OSBREAD](./../osbread) to read a block of data from the file, or [OSBWRITE](./../osbwrite) to write a block of data to the file. You also can use [READSEQ](./../readseq) to read a record from the file, or [WRITESEQ](./../writeseq) or [WRITESEQF](./../writeseqf) to write a record to the file, if the file is not a named pipe. ([READSEQ](./../readseq), [WRITESEQ](./../writeseq), [WRITESEQF](./../writeseqf) are line-oriented commands that use CHAR (10) as the line delimiter.)

An example of use would be a program statement that opens the file ‘MYSLIPPERS’ as SLIPPERS.

```
OSOPEN 'MYSLIPPERS' TO SLIPPERS ELSE STOP
```
