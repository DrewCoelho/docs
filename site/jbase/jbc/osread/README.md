## Description

Reads an OS file. It takes the general form:

```
OSREAD Variable FROM expression {ON ERROR Statements} {THEN | ELSE} Statements {END}
```

Where:

- **Variable** specifies the variable to contain the data from the read.
- **Expression** specifies the full file path. If the file resides in the JEDIFILEPATH then just the file name is required.
- ON ERROR **statements** conditional jBASE BASIC statements to execute if the **OSREAD** statement fails with a fatal error because the file is not open, an I/O error occurs, or jBASE cannot find the file. If you do not specify the **ON ERROR** clause and a fatal error occurs, the program terminates.

**THEN** | **ELSE** If the **OSREAD** statement fails it will execute any statements associated with an **ELSE** clause. If the **OSREAD** is successful, it will execute any statements associated with a **THEN** clause.

## Note

>
> Syntax requires either one or both of the **THEN** and **ELSE** clauses.
>
> **OSREAD** should not be used on large files. The jBASE BASIC **OSREAD** command reads an entire sequential file and assigns the contents of the file to a variable. If the file is too large for the program memory, the program aborts and generates a runtime error message. On large files, use [OSBREAD](./../osbread) or [READSEQ](./../readseq).
>
> jBASE uses the ASCII 0 character (CHAR (0)) as a string-end delimiter. ASCII 0 is not usable within string variable in jBASE BASIC. This command converts CHAR(0) to CHAR(128) when reading a block of data.

An example of use is as:

```
OSREAD MyFile FROM "C:\MyDirectory\MyFile" ELSE CRT "File not found"
```

to open a file located in the file-path.
