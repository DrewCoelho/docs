## Description

The **PRINT** statement sends data directly to the current output device, which will be either the terminal or the printer. It takes the general form:

```
PRINT expression {, expression...} {:}
```

An **expression** can evaluate to any data type. The **PRINT** statement will convert the result to a string type for printing. Expressions separated by commas will be sent to the output device separated by a tab character.

The **PRINT** statement will append a newline sequence to the final **expression** unless it is terminated with a colon ":" character.

## Note

> - As the **expression** can be any valid expression, it may have output formatting applied to it.
> - If a [PRINTER ON](./../printer) statement is currently active then output will be sent to the currently assigned printer form queue.

An example of use is as:

```
PRINT @(8,20):"Como esta?":
```
