## Description

The **PUTENV** function is used to set environment variables for the current process. It takes the general form:

```
PUTENV(expression)
```

**expression** should evaluate to a string of the form:

```
EnvVarName = value
```

Where **EnvVarName**Â is the name of a valid environment variable and **value** is any string that makes sense for the variable being set.

If the **PUTENV** function succeeds it returns a boolean TRUE value, if it fails it will return a boolean FALSE value.

## Note

> **PUTENV** only sets environment variables for the current process and processes spawned (say by [EXECUTE](./../execute)) by this process. These variables are known as export only variables.

An example of use is as:

```
IF PUTENV("JBASICLOGNAME = " : UserName) THEN
    CRT "Environment configured"
END
```
