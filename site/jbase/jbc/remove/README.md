## Description

**REMOVE** will successively extract delimited strings from a dynamic array.

```
REMOVE variable FROM array SETTING setvar
```

Where:

**variable** is the variable, which is to receive the extracted string.

**array** is the dynamic array from which the string is to be extracted.

**setvar** is set by the system during the extraction to indicate the type of delimiter found:

| <!----> | <!----> |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | end of the array |
| 1 | xFF ASCII 255 |
| 2 | xFE ASCII 254 Field marker |
| 3 | xFD ASCII 253 Value marker |
| 4 | xFC ASCII 252 Subvalue marker |
| 5 | xFB ASCII 251 |
| 6 | xFA ASCII 250 |
| 7 | xF9 ASCII 249 |

The first time the **REMOVE** statement is used with a particular array, it will extract the first delimited string it finds and set the special "remove pointer" to the start of the next string (if any). The next time **REMOVE** is used on the same array, the pointer will be used to retrieve the next string and so on. The array is not altered.

The **variable** named in the **SETTING** clause is used to record the type of delimiter that was found - to help determine whether the **REMOVE** statement extracted a field, a value or a subvalue for example.

Delimiters are defined as characters between xF9 and xFF only. Once the end of the array has been reached, the string **variable** will not be updated and the **SETTING** clause will always return 0. The "remove pointer" may be reset by assigning the **variable** to itself - for example REC = REC.

An example of use is as:

```
REC = "Field 1" : @FM : "Value 1" : @VM : " Value 2" : @FM : "Field 3"
REMOVE EXSTRING FROM REC SETTING DELIM
REMOVE EXSTRING FROM REC SETTING DELIM
```

The first time **REMOVE** is used, EXSTRING will contain "Field 1" and DELIM will contain xFE. The second time REMOVE is used, EXSTRING will contain "Value 1" and DELIM will contain xFD.
