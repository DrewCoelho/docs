## Description

The **WRITEU** statement allows a program to write a record into a previously opened file. An existing record lock will be preserved. It takes the general form:

```
WRITEU variable1 ON|TO { variable2,} expression {SETTING setvar} 
{ON ERROR statements}
```

Where:

**variable1** is the identifier holding the record to be written.

**variable2**, if specified, should be a jBASE BASIC variable that has previously been opened to a file using the [OPEN](./../open) statement. If **variable2** is not specified then the default file is assumed.

**expression** should evaluate to a valid record key for the file.

If the **SETTING** clause is specified and the write fails, setvar will be set to one of the [these values](./../incremental-file-errors).

If the statement fails to write the record then any statements associated with the **ON ERROR** clause is executed.

The lock maintained by the **WRITEU** statement will be released by any of the following events:

- the same program with [WRITE](./../write), [WRITEV](./../writev) or [MATWRITE](./../matwrite) statements writes to the record.
- the record lock is released explicitly using the [RELEASE](./../release) statement.
- the program stops normally or abnormally.

An example of use is as:

```
OPEN "Customers" ELSE ABORT 201, "Customers"
OPEN "DICT Customers" TO DCusts ELSE ABORT 201, "DICT Customers"

WRITEU Rec FROM DCusts, "Xref" Setting Err ON ERROR
    CRT "I/O Error[":Err:"]"
    ABORT
END
```
