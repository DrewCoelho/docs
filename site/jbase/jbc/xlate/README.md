## Description

The **XLATE** function will return the data value of a field, given the name of the file, the record key, the field number, and an action code. It takes the general form:

```
XLATE ([DICT] filename, key, field#, action.code)
```

Where:

**DICT** is the literal string to be placed before the file name in the event it is desired to open the dictionary portion of the file, rather than the data portion.

**filename** is a string containing the name of the file to be accessed. Note that it is the actual name of the file, and not a file unit variable. This function requires the file name, regardless of whether or not the file has been opened to a file unit variable.

**key** is an expression that evaluates to the record key, or item ID, of the record from which data is to be accessed.

**field#** is the field number to be retrieved from the record.

**action.code** indicates the procedure if the field is null, or cannot find the if record. This is a literal, which may be:

| <!----> | <!----> |
| --- | --- |
| X | Returns a null string. This is the default action |
| V | Prints an error message. |
| C | Returns the value of key |

If the field being accessed is a dynamic array, **XLATE** will return the array with the delimiter characters lowered by 1. For example, multivalue marks (ASCII-253) are returned as subvalue marks (ASCII-252), and subvalue marks are returned as text marks (ASCII-251). If supplied -1 for field#, it returns the entire record.

Examples of use include:

**1**. Retrieval of a simple field: Given a file called "VENDORS" containing a record with the record key of "12345" and which contains the value of "ABC Company" in field 1,

```
VENDOR.ID = "12345"
VENDOR.NAME = XLATE("VENDORS",VENDOR.ID,1,"X")
CRT VENDOR.NAME
```

to display: ABC Company

**2**. Retrieval of an array: Suppose field 6 of the VENDORS file contains a multivalued list of purchase order numbers, such as

10011]10062]10079 use the **XLATE** function to retrieve as :

```
PO.LIST = XLATE("VENDORS",VENDOR.ID,6,"X")
CRT PO.LIST
```

to display: 10011\10062\10079

Notice that the backslashes (\) were substituted for brackets (]), indicating that the delimiter is now CHAR(252).

**3**. Retrieval of an entire dictionary item: Given a dictionary item called "VENDOR.NAME" with the following content:

```
001 A
002 1
003 Vendor Name
004
005
006
007
008
009 L
010 30
```

using the statements:

```
DICT.ID = "VENDOR.NAME"
DICT.REC = XLATE("DICT VENDORS",VENDOR.ID,-1,"C")
CRT DICT.REC
```

to display: A]1]Vendor Name]]]]]L]30
