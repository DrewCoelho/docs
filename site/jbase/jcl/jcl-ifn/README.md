## Description

The command allows conditional execution of commands depending on the result of numeric comparisons. It takes the general form:

```
IFN reference operator expression command
```

where:

- **reference** can be a direct or indirect reference to a buffer or select register, or an A command without a surround character. Using an A command will not move a value but simply provides a reference to the parameter to be tested.
- **operator** performs a value comparison. Operators are:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| = | equal to |
| # | not equal to |
| &lt; | less than |
| &gt; | greater than |
| [ | less than or equal to |
| ] | greater than or equal to |

- **expression** can be one of the following:
  - A direct or indirect reference to a buffer or select register.
  - A string. If the string contains embedded spaces or the first character is an exclamation mark (!), percent sign (%) or ampersand (&), enclose the string in single or double quotes.
- **command** is a valid jCL command.

## Note

> IFN tests numbers by value, rather than their ASCIIÂ sequence of characters. Leading zeros are ignored, as are trailing decimal zeros.  
> For example, if %1 contains 00123.000, IFN %1 = 123 will be true.
>
> If a submitted value equates to null or is non-numeric, zero will be used. Leading plus or minus signs are allowed.

### Example 1

```
IFN %1 > 50 G 100
```

If %1 is greater than 50, control will be transferred to label 100.

### Example 2

```
IFN %1 [ 0 G 100
```

If %1 is less than or equal to 0, control will be transferred to label 100.

### Example 3

```
IFN A < %3 G 100
```

If the current parameter is less than %3, control will be transferred to label 100.
