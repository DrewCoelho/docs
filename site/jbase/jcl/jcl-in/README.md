## Description 

This command prompts for input and places it in the secondary input buffer. Selects the secondary input buffer as the active buffer input. It takes the general form:

```
IN{c}
```

where c is an optional prompt character which, once used, remains in effect until a new IBN, IBP, IN or IP command is issued. If c is not specified, the prompt character will default to the last prompt character used, or to a colon (:).

The new data replaces the content of the SIB, and the SIB will remain active until an [RI](https://static.zumasys.com/jbase/r99/knowledgebase/manuals/3.0/30manpages/man/jcl2_JCL.RI.htm), S(n) or MV %n source command is used.



## Note: 


> Leading and trailing spaces are removed and groups of one or more embedded spaces are replaced by a single field mark. Use the IBN command if you want to maintain embedded spaces. If the user responds with ENTER only, a null parameter will be created.


When the command has been completed, the buffer pointer will be positioned at the beginning of the buffer.
