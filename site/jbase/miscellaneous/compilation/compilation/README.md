## Description 

The **BASIC** command is provided as a front end program to the jBASE jbc compiler. The jbc compiler converts the BASIC code into "C" and invokes the native "C" compiler to convert the "C" source code into a machine native object file.

`BASIC BP PROGRAM1 SUB1`

The **BASIC** command creates the object record as $PROGRAM1 in file BP. The BP file can be any file type supported by jBASE, whether it is a hashed file, directory and so on.

The steps used by BASIC command are as follows:

- Any supplied record keys with a dollar/pound prefix or a **.o** or **.obj**suffix are ignored.
- The source is moved to the current working directory as a temporary file called **BASIC\_nn.c**, where **nn**is the users port number.
- The source is compiled using the **jcompile** command.
- The **.o** or **.obj** file is then moved back to the original source file with a dollar/pound prefix and the **.o** or **.obj** suffix removed.
- The command then cleans up any scratch files it created.




## Note: 


> If the original record key had a .b suffix then the .o or .objsuffix is not removed and the dollar/pound prefix not prepended.




A jBASE utility **jCompileFile** is available which invokes the BASIC compiler and produces an output and summary report, together with warnings and error lists. The syntax of **jCompileFile**is as follows:

```
jCompileFile -Options SourceFileName
```

where option may be:

- **-p** to direct output and report to printer,
- **-v**to direct output and report to screen


The conversion report, output, warning lists and error lists are stored in the **PortSave**directory as **jbc\_rep\_FileName**, **jbc\_out\_FileName**,   **jbc\_warn\_FileName** and j**bc\_err\_FileName** respectively. The jbc\_err\_FileName can be used to create a select list to supply to JED to enable correction of errors or problems. If executed again the **jCompileFile**will only attempt to compile records in the **jbc\_err\_FileName** list else the j**bc\_warn\_FileName** if either list is not empty. e.g.

```
FORM-LIST PortSave jbc_err_FileName
JED FileName
jCompileFile -v FileName
```
