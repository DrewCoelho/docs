# Multi-Tenancy

jBASE has excellent Multi-Tenancy capability via heavily definable configuration switches.

1. Independent Spoolers
2. Independent System File
3. Independent MD files
4. Independent List (POINTER-FILES).
5. Unique Port ranges.
6. O/S security to limit access to files.
7. Shared code and files between tenants.
