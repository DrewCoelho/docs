### Description

Audit logging creates phantom entries in the error log



### Previous Release Behavior

When audit logging was enabled on a file, each update to that file would create an entry in **$JBCRELEASEDIR/runtime-errors**.

### Current Release Behavior

The error log is not updated with a phantom entry.
