### Description

jQL: Issue with A/F correlative using Repeat function



**Current Release Behavior**

Prior to this patch, A/F correlatives of the form:

```
A;11:8R(G1-2)
F;11;8R(G1-2);:
```

would not repeat attribute 8.

This was a case where the jQL parser was not operating on the right-hand side of the formula when there was a conversion.
