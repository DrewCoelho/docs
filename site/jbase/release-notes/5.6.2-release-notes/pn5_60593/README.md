### Description

jBC: D3 style input timeout



### Previous Release Behavior

In D3 emulation, the jBC statements:

```
IN c FOR 0 ELSE CRT "No input provided."
INPUT reply FOR 0 ELSE CRT "No reply entered."
```

would wait indefinitely until something was entered.



### Current Release Behavior

When the FOR value is set to zero the statement will execute the ELSE clause.

Programs requiring this behavior must be compiled in D3 emulation.
