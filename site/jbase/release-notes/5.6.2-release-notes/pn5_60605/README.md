### Description

The jBASE **who** command conflict with Unix/Linux 'who'



### Previous Release Behavior

Running the 'who' command would always run the jBASE version regardless of what shell the user is in.

This was due to the installer placing $JBCRELEASEDIR/bin before /usr/bin.



### Current Release Behavior

The 'who' command now runs as expected from within the jShell and OS shells.
