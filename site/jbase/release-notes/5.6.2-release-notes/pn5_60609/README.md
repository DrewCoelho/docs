### Description

Correct the behavior of SYSTEM(0) for D3 emulation



### Previous Release Behavior

SYSTEM(0) was not coded for D3 emulation.



### Current Release Behavior

As per the D3 documentation, SYSTEM(0) returns the last error number usually. This is broadly compatible with other emulations.

However,  if the last error was caused by a LOCKED clause being taken on a READU,  then SYSTEM(0), under D3 emulation, returns the port number of the  process holding the lock.
