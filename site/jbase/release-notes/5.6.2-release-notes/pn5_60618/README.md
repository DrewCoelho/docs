### Description

Case Independence: PortBas issue - Reserved words following a ";" ignored



### Previous Release Behavior

Code such as:

```
rec = INSERT(rec, 42; CRT)
```

or:

```
LOCATE(string, array;VAR;SORT) ELSE NULL
```

PortBas would not recognize **CRT**, **VAR** or **SORT** as a reserved words.



### Current Release Behavior

PortBas now converts the reserved words in the above examples to **Crt**, **Var**, **Sort**.
