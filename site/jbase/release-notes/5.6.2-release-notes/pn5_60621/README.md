### Description

Case Independence: jFormateCode to move semi-colon separated INCLUDEs to a dedicated lines



### Current Release Behavior

Prior to this patch, semi-colon separated INCLUDE lines were ignored, e.g.

```
INCLUDE FILE-INC DEFAULTS ; INCLUDE FILE-INC VW.FILES
INCLUDE file-inc BILL.FILE ; INCLUDE file-inc BILL.TRANS; INCLUDE file-inc PROJECT.BILLING
INCLUDE file-inc BILL.CHGS ; INCLUDE file-inc BILL.CHGS.PARENT
```

now becomes:

```
INCLUDE FILE-INC DEFAULTS
INCLUDE FILE-INC VW.FILES
INCLUDE file-inc BILL.FILE
INCLUDE file-inc BILL.TRANS
INCLUDE file-inc PROJECT.BILLING
INCLUDE file-inc BILL.CHGS
INCLUDE file-inc BILL.CHGS.PARENT
```
