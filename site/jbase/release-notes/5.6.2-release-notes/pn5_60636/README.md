### Description

Record locking not case insensitive



### Previous Release Behavior

Under D3 emulation, item locks were not case insensitive.

READU/READVU/MATREADU would not respect locks on differently cased IDs.



### Current Release Behavior

Record locks are case insensitive.

We always store an upper case version of the ID.

Note: This case insensitivity matches D3 which means it is ALWAYS case insensitive regardless of CASING ON/OFF or CASE ON/OFF.
