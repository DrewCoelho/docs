### Description

Locks would remain after a file is closed.



### Previous Release Behavior

When a file was closed as shown below, any locks would remain as the file cacheing would prevent the file from being closed.

```
OPEN "file" TO DSCB ELSE STOP 201,"file"
READU rec FROM DSCB,"key" ELSE NULL
DSCB = 0 ;* This would normally close the file and release the locks
```



### Current Release Behavior

If the closed file has taken any locks at any time, then a check is made for those locks and the equivalent of a **RELEASE filevar** statement is executed.
