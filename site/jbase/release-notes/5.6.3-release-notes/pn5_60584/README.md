## Description

jQL: Allow [Ann] style default dictionaries for d3 emulation

### Previous Release Behavior

You needed to prepend [\*] to use a default dictionary

### Current Release Behavior

In d3 emulation, Ann is a valid default dictionary and is synonymous with \*Ann.

If there are already Ann dictionaries in the file, they will override the default dictionary of the same name.

Note that the column headers will show as \*An [not An] as this differentiates defaults from user dictionaries.
