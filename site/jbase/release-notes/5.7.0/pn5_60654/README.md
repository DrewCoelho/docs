## Description

Change the way the MD is created with the **create-account** command

### Previous Release Behavior

The **MD** was always created as a Case Sensitive file.

### Current Release Behavior

- The **MD** now follows the effective emulation, so if the emulation specifies that all files are to be created as Case Insensitive then so will the **MD**.
