### Description

Support $INSERT and INSERT as compiler directives



### Previous Release Behavior

In releases prior to jBASE 5.7, the compiler accepted $INSERT and INSERT as compiler directives equivalent to INCLUDE. The new pre-processor doesn't.



### Current Release Behavior

$INSERT and INSERT are now supported as synonyms for INCLUDE.

This means the syntax is the same as INCLUDE, ie "INSERT ITEMID" or "INSERT FILENAME ITEMID"
