### Description

Support DEFFUN with no parameters and no parenthesis



### Previous Release Behavior

The DEFFUN statement would need () even if there were no parameters, e.g.

```
    DEFFUN MYFUNCTION()
```

This was incompatible with Universe code.



### Current Release Behavior

Parenthesis are optional. This is now supported

```
    DEFFUN MYFUNCTION
```
