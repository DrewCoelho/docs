## Description

New security paradigm for jBASE files and utilities.

### Previous Release Behavior

The previous release had a per-file security basis, which meant each secure file had a corresponding ]K file.

Some of the jBASE utilities were not working correctly with this security model.

### Current Release Behavior

jBASE now employs a system wide security mode as described [here](./../../../encryption/jbase-encryption-database-security/README.md).

Back to [5.7.1 Release Notes](./../README.md)
