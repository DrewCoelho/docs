### Description

**CREATE-ACCOUNT**does not respect **JEDI\_PREFILEOP**when it creates the MD



### Previous Release Behavior

By default, the **CREATE-ACCOUNT** command creates the MD as type **JD** (Dynamic).

Setting **JEDI\_PREFILEOP**with a type of **JP** or **J4** would cause CREATE-ACCOUNT to produce the following error when it attempted to create the MD:



```
Failed to create MD in new account!
[ 416 ] Illegal or missing modulo or separation
```



### Current Release Behavior

The type of the MD can now be overridden with JEDI\_PREFILEOP but only as types **JP** or **J4**.

The default is still type **JD** if **JEDI\_PREFILEOP** is not used.
