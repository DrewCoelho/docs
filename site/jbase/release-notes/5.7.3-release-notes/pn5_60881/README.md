### Description

**GET-LIST**in D3 emulation changes characters in the select-list



### Previous Release Behavior

In D3 emulation, issuing a **GET-LIST**on an exploded-list, i.e. a list with entries of the form **id]vn**, caused the value-marks to be converted to sub-value-marks.



### Current Release Behavior

Value-marks are retained.
