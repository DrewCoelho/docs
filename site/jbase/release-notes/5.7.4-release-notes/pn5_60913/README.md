### Description

Remove the restriction which prevents 2 or more copies of jlogdup restoring to the same machine simultaneously



### Previous Release Behavior

If you tried to load 2 copies of jlogdup with the 'set=database' option, you would get the following message and it would reject the second load.



```
ERROR:    
Cannot have 2 copies of jlogdup restoring to the database simultaneously
```



### Current Release Behavior

The error has now been replaced with a warning, and allows the operation to continue.

```
WARNING:
There are 2 copies of jlogdup restoring to the database simultaneously
```
