## Description

**listf -xml** fails on Linux

### Previous Release Behavior

The **listf -xml** command did not produce complete xml output.

This was primarily due to the jBASE **stat** command conflicting with the Linux one.

### Current Release Behavior

**listf -xml** produces correct xml output.
