### Description

jBC: Remove the limit imposed by **INPUT**on **DATA**stack



### Previous Release Behavior

On the previous releases there was a fixed limit on an **INPUT** statement of 32768 (and on earlier releases 1024).

```
l = 100000
DATA STR('X',l)
INPUT val
IF LEN(VAL) EQ l THEN CRT 'Success' ELSE CRT 'Failure' ;! we would see "Failure"
```



### Current Release Behavior

The length restriction has been removed and the above test would print "Success"
