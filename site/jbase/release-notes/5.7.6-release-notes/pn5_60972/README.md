### Description

**PH-STATUS** facelift



### Previous Release Behavior

The **PH-STATUS** command's user interface was extremely limited.



### Current Release Behavior

\* The output is now sorted: **BY STATUS-ALPHA BY-DSND START-DATE BY-DSND START-TIME BY LINE**

\* The output can be restricted by specifying one or more valid status codes as options. For example, to display only Active tasks:



```
ph-status (a
```

\* The command-line options are case insensitive

\* A select-list can be passed to it

\* A check is done to ensure that a task marked as Active is still active; if it isn't then the status is changed to **X**. This could happen if the port was logged off or the task was killed in an abnormal manner.

\* Added help page which can be envoked with -h or -?

\* The **PH-HISTORY** file is now created as a Dynamic File
