## Description

jQL: Selection criteria on date conversion fails on multi-value field

### Previous Release Behavior

Only the first multi-value was left in internal format, giving the wrong result.

### Current Release Behavior

All multi-values are processed correctly, i.e. the date conversion is applied to every internal value.
