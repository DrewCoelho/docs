# PN1013

## Description

This patch provides the D3 behavior of truncating the default display of the ID to the width defined in the dictionary item.

The conditions required for this behavior are twofold:

1) The ID of the dictionary item must be the same as the filename
2) `jql_id_attr10_subtring = true` must be set in the emulation
