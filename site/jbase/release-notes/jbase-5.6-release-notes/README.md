# WHAT'S NEW



NATIVE RESTFUL SERVICES

RESTful Services has become one of the most important technologies for integrating business applications with the web. As a universal way for applications to communicate with each other, every major development language now includes frameworks for building RESTful Services. Native RESTful Services in jBASE 5.6 allows us to bypass proprietary APIs and open up your jBASE database to any language environment, web service or application. Developers can now unleash the power of their application and communicate in a modern way with powerful web services and SaaS applications, like Salesforce, Dynamics or NetSuite. These innovations will allow our customers’ time-proven intellectual property to ride the latest technological trends that are transforming the world of business.

GRANULAR AUDIT LOGGING

Building on the success of jBASE 5.5, we’ve increased the granularity of logging options to enable deeper event audits for customers with even the most stringent compliance requirements. Now you can set logging options globally or at an individual file level. You can also apply audit logs to a remote copy of jBASE to accelerate the backup process and improve recovery point objectives.

UPDATED SYSTEM MANAGER

System Manager provides a single pane of glass from which to manage your jBASE database. We’ve updated this powerful web tool with improved file management capabilities, audit logging configuration capabilities, and user session management. From jBASE System Manager, you can now remotely manage all active user sessions and log out inactive users as needed.

NATIVE DATA ENCRYPTION

Get built-in data security and protection with the standard jBASE product for no additional cost. Native data encryption now makes it easy to meet increasing compliance requirements with granular encryption at the file level. Choose between file-level encryption and spooler-level encryption while maintaining the high performance your users expect.
