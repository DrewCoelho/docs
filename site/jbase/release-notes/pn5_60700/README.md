### Description

Execution of Paragraphs to pass back the values to the SETTING variable



### Previous Release Behavior

If a program was to do...

```
0001     EXECUTE "SELECT MD" CAPTURING quiet SETTING err1 RTNLIST mylist
0002     EXECUTE "SAVE-LIST D3MD" CAPTURING quiet SETTING err2 PASSLIST mylist
0003     EXECUTE "COUNT MD" CAPTURING quiet SETTING err3
0004     EXECUTE "LIST MD SAMPLE 10" CAPTURING quiet SETTING err4
0005     EXECUTE "LIST BAD_FILENAME" CAPTURING quiet SETTING err5
0007     err = ""
0008     err<1> = err1
0009     err<2> = err2
0010     err<3> = err3
0011     err<4> = err4
0012     err<5> = err5
0014     CRT OCONV(err, "MCP")
```

...it would display something like:

```
404]332]QLNUMSEL^241]332]D3MD]Savelist_msg^407]332]QLNUMCNT^405]10]QLNUMLIST^401]QLBADFILE
```

If a paragragh were to do the same thing,

```
ID: PARATEST
001 PA
002 SELECT MD
003 SAVE-LIST D3MD
004 COUNT MD
005 LIST MD SAMPLE 10
006 LIST BAD_FILENAME
```

and EXECUTE that paragraph in a program,

```
0001    EXECUTE "PARATEST" CAPTURING quiet SETTING err
```

it would return NULL in the "err" variable.



### Current Release Behavior

The new behavior populates the variable in the SETTING clause with a dynamic array of return codes, e.g.

```
JPQ]404]332]QLNUMSEL^241]332]D3MD]Savelist_msg^407]332]QLNUMCNT^405]10]QLNUMLIST^401]QLBADFILE
```
