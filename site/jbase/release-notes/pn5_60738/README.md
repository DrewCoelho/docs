### Description

Utilities: Add an option to the **config-strings** command to display output in Config\_EMULATE format.



### Previous Release Behavior

The **config-strings** utility was only able to display the configuration in one way, i.e. with the configuration option and value separated by several spaces, e.g.

```
configuration_option                   value
```



### Current Release Behavior

A new option, -c, allows you to display the configuration in the same format as it appears in the Config\_EMULATE file, e.g.

```
configuration_option = value 
```

This allows you to cut-and-paste the output into a new configuration.
