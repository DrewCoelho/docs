## Description

The **SP-FQSCRIPT** command creates a script from the current spooler configuration that can be used to regenerate
the spooler form queue definitions after running SP-NEWTAB.

The script is written in the current directory and is called **create-form-queues.bat** on Windows and **create-form-queues** on non-Windows platforms.

It takes the general form:

```text
SP-FQSCRIPT
```

> ### Note

> Once the script is created you are free to change it in any way.
>
> It is recommended to save this script in a secure location.
