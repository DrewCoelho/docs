## Description

The **SP-NEWTAB** command creates a new spooler structure. It takes the general form:

```
SP-NEWTAB
```

## Details

This command can only be executed by root or an administrator. The default directory in which the spooler files are created is called "jspooler". However, **SP-NEWTAB** allows a different directory to be specified. Before a user can access the spooler, its location must be specified using the environment variable JBCSPOOLERDIR. On UNIX platforms, **SP-NEWTAB** prompts for the owner and group to be assigned to the spooler files. If not specified the owner is set to "root" and the group is set to "lp".

**SP-NEWTAB** allows security settings for form queues and print jobs. These can be changed subsequently by using the commands [SP-SECURITY](./../sp-security), [SP-SECURITY-JOBS](./../sp-security-jobs), [SP-SECURITY-OWNER](./../sp-security-owner) and [SP-SECURITY-QUEUE](./../sp-security-queue). Please refer to the documentation for a full discussion of the security settings.

The **SP-NEWTAB** command does not kill despooling daemons. If a process was assigned to any formqueue other than STANDARD when the **SP-NEWTAB** command was executed, the process will be assigned to NO QUEUE.

The default formqueue STANDARD is re-initialized with a LPTR logical device type.

> ### Note
>
> **SP-NEWTAB** removes all print jobs and form queues. The STANDARD formqueue is recreated.
