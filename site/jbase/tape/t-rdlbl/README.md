## Description  

The **T-RDLBL** command will read the first block from the tape device, determine if the block is a recognized label and either display the label information or inform the user that the media is not labeled. The command takes the general form:

```
T-RDLBL {CHANNEL=channel}
```

where **channel** is the specific channel attachment (0-9).
