## Selective Restores

There may be a time when a selective restore is preferable to a full restore. Â This cannot be automated and has to be judged on its own merits.

### By Path

In this example, all updates to the CUSTOMER file which have been logged, except for any CLEARFILEs, are re-applied to the CUSTOMER file.

```
:SSELECT TJ1 WITH PATH EQ "C:\jBASE\CUSTOMER" AND WITH TYPE NE "CLEARFILE"
167 Records selected
>jlogdup INPUT set=current OUTPUT set=database
```

### By Type

In this example, all updates to the CUSTOMER file which have been logged, except for any CLEARFILEs, are re-applied to the CUSTOMER file.

```
:SSELECT TJ1 WITH TYPE NE "CLEARFILE"
167 Records selected
>jlogdup INPUT set=current OUTPUT set=database
```
