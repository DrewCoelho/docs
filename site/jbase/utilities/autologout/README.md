# AUTOLOGOUT

<PageHeader />

## Description

The **AUTOLOGOUT** command enables a session to be automatically logged off should there be no keyboard activity for a specified time.

It takes the general form:

```
AUTOLOGOUT {n {program {program Args}}} {(C)}
```

where:

- **n** is the number of minutes of keyboard inactivity required before the session is logged off.
- **program** is the name of a program to run before the session is logged off.
- **program args** can be specified for **program**.
- The **(C** option causes the name of the **program** that will be executed to be displayed.

If no program is specified when the AUTOLOGOUT command is issued, a program called **ON.EXIT** will be executed prior to the session being logged off. It is left to the user to define the functionality of ON.EXIT. To reset the auto logout, specify 0 for the number of minutes, or disconnect and reconnect from jBASE.

## Notes

Inactivity is defined as a program waiting at an INPUT or IN statement.

If no program is specified when the AUTOLOGOUT command is issued, a program called **ON.EXIT** will be executed prior to the session being logged off. It is left to the user to define the functionality of ON.EXIT. To reset the auto logout, specify 0 for the number of minutes, or disconnect and reconnect from jBASE.

## Examples

```
jsh -->AUTOLOGOUT 10                         Automatic logout is set for 10 minutes.`
jsh -->AUTOLOGOUT 15 OFF                     Automatic logout is set for 15 minutes.Command to execute when invoked = 'OFF'`
```
