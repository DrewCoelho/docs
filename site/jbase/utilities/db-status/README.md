## Description

This can be used to check the status of jBASE databases, i.e running or paused. It may be invoked as:

```
DB-STATUS option
```

where option may be:

- The **-a** option specifies that all databases should be shut down (This option is restricted to jBASE 5)
- The **-n** option specifies the database to shut down Â ( This option is restricted to jBASE 5)
- Use the **-t** option to display users currently inside a transaction.
- The **-v** option is the verbose option.
- Use the **-w** option to display all users currently suspended and waiting for a DB-RESUME.
- The **-V** option is the very verbose option and is the equivalent of -t, -v and -w together.

Run this command as any user which also shows the status of the DB-PAUSE command

An example of use may be:

```
# DB-STATUS -V
DatajBASE paused at Mon Nov 25 16:13:36 2002
For READ and WRITE operations
Updates are denied also to root users
Existing transactions can continue until complete
Port 4 is waiting for DB-RESUME
Port 23 is waiting for DB-RESUME
Port 31 is inside a transaction
1 ports inside a transaction, 2 ports waiting for DB-RESUME
```

One common usage of these commands will be to split mirrors on a mirrored disk system. One of the mirrors can then continue a jBASE operation following a DB-RESUME and the other mirror, which is now quiescent, used for a fast backup using operating system specific backup tools.

## Note

> This utility is only available in jBASE 4.1 and later.
