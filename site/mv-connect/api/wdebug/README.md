# WDEBUG

<PageHeader />

The `WDEBUG` program is a debugging tool for REST services.

## WDEBUG Syntax

```
WDEBUG
```

### WDEBUG Setup

Use the `WDEBUG` program to:

- View REST request headers, variables, body and response
- Modify request headers, variables, etc. and re-run the request
- Invoke your REST handler so you can use the system debugger to debug your handler

In order to use `WDEBUG`, the MV Connect startup routine `WDB.INIT` saves request details in the `WDB.DEBUG` file. When you first install MV Connect, only the dictionary of the `WDB.DEBUG` file is created. To use W`DEBUG, you need to create the data section for the file:

```
CREATE-FILE DATA WDB.DEBUG 101
```

Debug information is enabled for each REST resource independently. `Attribute 7` of the `WDB.RESOURCE` record for each resource contains a flag to enable debugging for that resource. Set `attribute 7` of the resource record to `1` to enable debugging.

### WDEBUG Debugging

With debugging enabled for the desired resource, submit a REST request you want to debug, from a client (browser, PostMan, curl, etc.). After the request has been processed, type `WDEBUG` from a command (TCL, ECL, jsh, etc.) prompt. Recent requests will be displayed, showing some of the request details to help identify the specific request you intend to debug. Select the request by entering the line number at the command prompt. You can also display the previous or next page of requests, refresh the list of requests, clear all requests in the `WDB.DEBUG` file, or quit the `WDEBUG` program.

```
Command: (Q)uit (R)efresh (C)lear (N)ext (P)rev (##) Line to debug:
```

After selecting a request, you can view, edit or run the request. If you run the request, any edits you have made are applied to the request. The first time you edit a request, you are prompted to select the editor you want to use (ED, JED, SED, AE, Â or an editor of your choice).

```

When viewing or editing a request, the request details are organized into sections:

| Section          | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| INFO             | General request information (not editable)                                    |
| HEADERS          | Request headers, including some pseudo-headers like `PATH_INFO`               |
| COOKIES          | Any cookies associated with the request, parsed from the `HTTP_COOKIE` header |
| PARAMS           | Parsed from the `PATH_INFO` header                                            |
| SESSION          | The session `ID` and any session variables set by calling `PUT.SESSION.VAR`   |
| RESPONSE_HEADERS | `Headers` returned by your REST handler                                       |
| RESPONSE_CONTENT | `Content` returned by your REST handler                                       |

Any changes you make to the request are saved in a temporary copy of the request. The original record in `WDB.DEBUG` is not changed. When editing the request, if you need to modify any cookies, make your changes in the `COOKIES` section rather than in the `HTTP_COOKIE` header. Similarly, for request parameters, edit items in the `PARAMS` section rather than the `PATH_INFO` header.

When you select `(R)un` from the command prompt, the original environment used for handling the request is reconstructed, including any edits you have made to the request. Your REST handler is called and the new response is saved in the tempoary copy of the request, which you can view, edit or run again. If you want to use the system debugger to debug your REST handler, you can test if the request is being run from `WDEBUG` by querying `SESSION$WDEBUG.MODE`:

```
CALL WGETINFO(IS.DEBUGGING,SESSION_WDEBUG_MODE)
IF IS.DEBUGGING THEN DEBUG
```
