# WSEND

<PageHeader />

The WSEND subroutine sends content generated by your handler data back to the client. Â This is usually HTML, JSON or XML.

You can call WSEND multiple times if your content is generated in stages. After the final call to WSEND, you should call WFLUSH.

WSEND can buffer content for performance or other reasons (see WSETBUFFER). By default buffering is disabled. When buffering is enabled, it is possible to set headers after calling WSEND, but before calling WFLUSH. Otherwise, all headers must be set before the first call to WSEND.
