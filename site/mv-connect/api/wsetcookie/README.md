The WSETCOOKIE subroutine will set a cookie to be sent back to the browser.

#### **COMMAND SYNTAX**

```

#### **SYNTAX ELEMENTS**


| <!----> | <!----> |
| --- | --- |
| NAME | Name of the cookie you want to set |
| VALUE | Value you wish to set the cookie to |
| EXPDATE | Date you wish the cookie to expire on.  Use pick internal dates. |
| EXPTIME | Time you wish the cookie to expire (used with EXPDATE).  Use pick internal times. |
| PATH | Path you wish the cookie to apply to.  Use "/" for all. |

#### NOTES

The WSETCOOKIE command basically builds a Set-Cookie header.  This function properly formats the Set-Cookie for you and understands pick date and time formats.  If you wish more control you can use the WSETHEADER and build your own Set-Cookie line.

Here is a good [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie "Link to Set-Cookie documentation") on how Set-Cookie works.
