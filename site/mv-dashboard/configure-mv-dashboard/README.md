**Original ID:** 260516  
**Internal:** No  


Now that you have installed the MV Dashboard, you should be able to connect to the application server's configuration utility using your favorite web browser. This is where you will configure your database connection, install the base multivalue database and activate your software.

## **Connecting to the Configuration Utility**

To connect, open your web browser and point it to the name or IP address of your database server. Make sure to include the TCP port number that you selected during the installation in the address bar. For example, if you accepted the default port, your web address might be:

http://my.pickserver.com:8180/config

Login to the MultiValue Application Server as the user "admin" with the password "admin".

The MV Dashboard Configuration Utility displays. The tabs at the top of the screen allow you to navigate through the various configuration screens.



## Configuring your Database Connection

Now that you have connected to the configuration utility, you are ready to configure your database connection. The Database tab provides the interface for setting-up all of the parameters specific to your multivalue database.

To configure your database connection:

1. Select the Database tab.
2. Select the platform from the provided list.

# RUNNING THE DASHBOARD IN FLASHED MODE

As installed, MV Dashboard control programs and subroutines are not flash-compiled. Complete these instructions to run the dashboard in flashed mode.

To run the dashboard in flashed mode:

1. Log onto the MVDB account of the D3 server on which the dashboard is installed.

2. Run these commands:

```
COMPILE RSS.BP (O 
COMPILE MVBP.BP (OW 
COMPILE WDB.BP (OW 
COMPILE MVDB.SUBS (O
```



3. Change attribute 1 in the COMPILE.SETUP item (controls the manner in which the Dashboard code editor compiles widget subroutines) in the MVDB.CONTROL file in the MVDB account from:

```
BASIC %FILENAME% %ITEMNAME%
```

to:

```
COMPILE %FILENAME% %ITEMNAME% (O
```

4. Save the updated item.

The dashboard will now run in flashed mode and will flash compile any new or modified widget subroutines.

| WARNING<br> | If you choose to run the Dashboard in flashed mode, make sure that all subroutines called from your existing application are flash-compiled as well. |


# **DISABLING FLASHED MODE**

Complete these instructions to disable flashed mode. To disable flashed mode:

1. Change attribute 1 in the COMPILE.SETUP item in the MVDB.CONTROL file in the MVDB account from:


```
COMPILE %FILENAME% %ITEMNAME% (O
```

to:

```
BASIC %FILENAME% %ITEMNAME%
```

2. Save the updated item.

3. Un-flash the programs by running the following commands:

```
DEOPTIMIZE DICT RSS.BP 
DEOPTIMIZE DICT MVBP.BP 
DEOPTIMIZE DICT WDB.BP
