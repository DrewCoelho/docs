## What are the supported platforms for MultiValue Dashboard

[Requirements Page](../../installation-guide/requirements/README.md)

## Pick is on my Linux machine.  How do I connect from Windows to Linux Pick?

When you load MultiValue Dashboard onto your Pick/Linux machine, the MultiValue Dashboard will create a webserver on that machine. You can then access MultiValue Dashboard from any of your machines connected to that webserver using a web browser.

## Is Zumasys available to help with programming for MultiValue Dashboard?

Yes.  Please contact 866-ZUMASYS for a quote.

## I am having problems with the source code editor

There is a reported bug in the dashboard source code editor. We are working to duplicate and resolve the reported issue. Until resolved, it is recommended that the dashboard source code editor ONLY be used for viewing source code. If intending to create, or modify, source code use ED, WED, or your normal source code editor.
