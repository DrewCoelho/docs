# Licensing/Upgrades

## How is MultiValue Dashboard licensed?  Are DashBoard users tied to the MV user count?

MultiValue Dashboard is licensed per user for each MV database instance.

## What's the difference between a single user license and a multi-user license?

The single user license is free and a multi-user license is paid. The single user license is best used for evaluation and by developers who would obtain a multi-user license when ready for full implementation.

## What happens when I want to upgrade from the single user license to the multi-user license?

Contact Zumasys and a new System ID will be provided.
