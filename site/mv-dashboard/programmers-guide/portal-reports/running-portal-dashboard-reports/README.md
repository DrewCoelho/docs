Running the Portal Dashboard Reports

* Run the Portal Reports Setup to configure the elements necessary to run the reports.  See the Portal Reports Setup Documentation

* Run the Portal Dashboard to view the summary of sales and financials.

  * The dashboard wants to have calculations refreshed within the past 15 minutes.  If, when starting the dashboard, it has been over 15 minutes since the last calculations, a temporary display will show that figures are updating.  After a satisfactory delay of a minute or so, click the Go button and the summary of sales and financials page should display.  If not, repeat until it displays.

  * Leaving the dashboard running with Auto-Refresh slider activated for about every 5 minutes will automatically refresh the dashboard display and trigger a background recalculation of numbers when necessary.

  * The title section of each dashboard page shows the date and time the last calculations were run.

* On the summary of sales and financials, those labels underlined and displayed in a color can drilled down on to display additional dashboards.

  * Drill down on Sales to initiate the Portal Sales Reports dashboard

  * Drill down on Gross Profit (GP$) to initiate the same Portal Sales Reports dashboard

  * Drill down on Margin (GP%) to initiate the Portal Year to Year Margins dashboard

  * Drill down on the Balances as of MM-DD-YY to initiate the AR and AP dashboard

* After doing a drill downs, the browser back button can be used to navigate back to the previous dashboard, or simply clicking on the Portal Dashboard tab will re-initialize back to the summary of sales and financials.
