# Types

<PageHeader />

Each widget must declare its type and provide the necessary information for that widget type. Some widget types are unique, such as HTML, TEXT, and TABLE widgets. However, many chart and graph widget types are similar to one another in the information that they need in order to present the graphic display. For example, a line graph and a column chart are similar in that they involve plotting a series of values along a series of categories. Therefore, these two widget types require the same variables to be populated with information in the same way.
