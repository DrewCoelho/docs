Developing dashboard widgets requires the creation of a BASIC program to provide the following information:

1. The type of widget to be displayed, e.g., a chart, map, table, preformatted text, or HTML.
2. The widget title that will appear in the title bar of the widget that is displayed.
3. The width of the widget (i.e. 1=Narrow, 2=Medium, or 3=Wide)
4. The data used to formulate the chart or map, table, the raw HTML, or the preformatted text depending on the type of widget being created.


Additionally, the program may provide information to invoke other behaviors of the widget such as links, icons, or input prompts to appear in the widget display.
