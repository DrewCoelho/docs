**Purpose**  
The PD.E procedure is used to create or modify procedure definitions.
Procedure definitions are data entry, report and inquiry screens. There are
four screens available in the PD.E procedure.  
  
Each prompt is defined in detail on screen 4, including the on- line helps
which will be available to the user. Other charac- teristics of the prompt
such as length, mininum input and valid entries are defined.  
  
Once each prompt has been defined, they are placed in prompt sequence on
screen two. Multiple screens are allowed to be defined.  
  
Screen three contains the dataset relationships of fields which are related or
associated with other fields such as schedule dates and quantities which are
considered together.  
  
Upon filing, the user can elect to compile the procedure which will verify the
accuracy and completeness of the data entered. If the procedure compiles
successfully, the user can also elect to create or update the formatted
screen. Alternatively, the user may use the DS command (Draw Screen) to update
or create screens.

**Frequency of Use**  
As needed to create new or update existing screens.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
