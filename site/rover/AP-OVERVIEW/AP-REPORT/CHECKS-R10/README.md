# CHECKS.R10 â€“ Check Remittance Report

<PageHeader />

The `CHECKS.R10` procedure is used to print a remittance report for vendors or payees corresponding to one or more checks. This is primarily used for ACH-type payments. The report output mimics check stub information and may optionally be sent to vendors via automated email with a PDF attachment.

## Purpose

The `CHECKS.R10` program generates a detailed report summarizing payment details. The report can be printed or emailed to vendors as supporting documentation for payments.  

If email is enabled, the system uses the address stored on the **Payments** tab of `VENDOR.E`. A PDF version of the report is sent as an attachment.

## Frequency of Use

## Prerequisites

- No special prerequisites.  
- For automated emailing: Ensure the vendor has a valid email address on the **Payments** tab of `VENDOR.E`.
