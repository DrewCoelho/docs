[ Form Details ](FY-P3-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The FY.P3 procedure is used to purge inactive GLBAL records from the data
base. The criteria used to deterime which records are purged is based on a
user defined cut-off date. All GLBAL records which are on file for the
selected year will be deleted. It is recommended that this process only be run
when it is certain that no further financial reporting will be done using the
fiscal year selected. This includes prior year analysis.

**Frequency of Use**  
The frequency with which a purge is performed will vary depending on such
factors as available disk space and the amount of on-line history desired.

**Prerequisites**  
It is strongly recommended that a full account backup be performed prior to
executing any purge process. It is also recommended that this be a permanent
backup so that any records which were purged can be restored at a later date
if required.
