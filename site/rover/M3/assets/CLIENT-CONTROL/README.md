## CLIENT.CONTROL (CLIENT.CONTROL)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Version](../CLIENT-CONTROL-1/README.md)[Settings](../CLIENT-CONTROL-2/README.md)



**Purpose**
The client control procedure provides a method for controlling the version
level of the M3 Client programs installed on the workstations accessing the
system. In some cases, particularly when a new version of the ACE host account
has been installed, there may be restrictions on the client versions that can
be, or should be, used to access the host. This forma allows you to specify
the applicable version methods that may present problems and provide feedback
to the user about what actions should be taken. You also have the option of
dissallowing access in certain cases.

**Frequency of Use**
As required, but usually when installing a new version of the ACE host
account.

**Prerequisites**
None.
