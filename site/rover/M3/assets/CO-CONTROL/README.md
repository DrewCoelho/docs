## Company Definition Entry (CO.CONTROL)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Corporate](../CO-CONTROL-1/README.md)
[Companies](../CO-CONTROL-2/README.md)

**Purpose**
The CO.CONTROL procedure is used to define company name and address
information which will be used by the reports to generate headings.
Additionally, there is a tab on the CO.CONTROL procedure to define company
codes. These codes can be used to define individual "companies" within the
same accounting system. If this method is used, then separate reports and
agings can be run, even within the same data account. Generally, this method
is used when separate accounting entities are required, but share the same
order (Sales Order, Purchase Order, etc.) files.

Before using the system, at least one company code must be defined. In most
cases, using "1" as a default company code is sufficient. If only one code is
used, it will be defaulted into all data entry screens at the company code
prompt.

**Frequency of Use**
Generally, this need only be done when the system is initially installed.

**Prerequisites**
None.
