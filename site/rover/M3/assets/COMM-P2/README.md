**Purpose**
The COMM.P2 procedure is used to flag all eligible commission records as paid.
In this way, if commission records are later posted into a previous period, it
will be possible to determine which commision items have already been paid and
which are new for a period.

**Frequency of Use**
This procedure is normally used at month end after commission checks have been
prepared.

**Prerequisites**
Commission records must exist.
