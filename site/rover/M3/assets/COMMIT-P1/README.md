## Regenerate Commitments File (COMMIT.P1)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../COMMIT-P1-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The COMMIT.P1 procedure recalculates and sets the committed inventory figures
in the inventory (INV) and commitment (COMMIT) files from all files which
commit materials.

**Frequency of Use**
The inventory commitments are maintained automatically as sales orders are
entered and shipments are processed. Therefore, the only time you really need
to run this procedure is when the file has been corrupted or records are being
converted from another system.

**Prerequisites**
None.
