## Customer Cross-Reference Rebuild Process (CUST.P1)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../CUST-P1-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The CUST.P1 procedure rebuilds the customer name and phone cross-reference
fields to make lookups faster and easier.

**Frequency of Use**
The cross-references is maintained automatically as customer records are
entered. Therefore, the only time you really need to run this procedure is
when the file has been corrupted, or after a file conversion.

**Prerequisites**
The name and phone cross reference fields should be indexed in the FDICT.E
procedure.
