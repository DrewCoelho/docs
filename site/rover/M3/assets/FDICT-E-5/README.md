## SQL Definition

![](./FDICT-E-5.jpg)

| **Default SQL Definition**|  Displays the default SQL definition as
generated by the system. This definition will be used to generate the SQL
tables unless an alternate definition is defined in the Custom SQL field.

-  
**Custom SQL Text**|  If the default SQL definition created by the system does
not meet your requirements you may enter your own definition in this field. It
should be noted that this definition will not be adjusted when changes are
made to the dictionary as is the case with the default definition. Therefore
you must make any adjustments manually.
