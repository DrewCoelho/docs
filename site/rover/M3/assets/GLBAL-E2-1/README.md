| **Acct * year**|  This field contains an account number and a fiscal year
which, together make up the key to the GLBAL file. You can either access an
existing record to add or update the previous balance amounts. After the first
time you enter the fiscal year, you may enter only the account number and the
previously entered fiscal year will default.

**Acct desc**|  The account description is loaded from the GLCHART file. It
cannot be changed during this procedure. It is displayed for identification
purposes only.

**Previous Balance**|  Enter the previous balance for this record. When
entering a credit balance, include the minus sign. For example, a credit
balance of 200,000.00 should be entered as -200,000.00.
