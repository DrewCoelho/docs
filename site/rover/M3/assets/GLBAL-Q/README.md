<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../GLBAL-Q-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The GLBAL.Q procedure provides an inquiry for a General Ledger account number.
The user may enter an account number, then define a range of periods within
single fiscal year to display. If the summary option is selected, then the
period end balances for each period in the range are displayed. If the summary
option is not selected, then the detail journal entries are displayed. In this
case, whenever a journal entry was posted from a register file, the detail
icon may be used to drill down to the register detail for that transaction.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
To use the detail display button on screen, the journal entry must have been
created from a register interface.
