**Purpose**
The LOG.E procedure provides the ability to enter log entries to record
interactions related to various documents or entities. Log entries are most
often initiated from other procedures such as customer master entry
([CUST.E](../CUST-E/README.md)), sales order entry ([SO.E](../SO-E/README.md)) and contact entry
([CONTACT.E](../CONTACT-E/README.md)) etc. These procedure will have a page, usually
called Logs, that list all of the log entries related to the current record.
You then have the option of opening an existing log or adding a new one.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.
