## Menu Entry (MENU.E)

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../MENU-E-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The MENU.E procedure is used update system menus. This is normally used to add
new procedures to existing menus, but also may be used to customize menus for
your specific needs, such as adding a special menu for all sales personnel
containing a limited number of items. This should not be done if the intent is
to secure the user to a limited number of options. This is more easily
accomplished by controlling procedure access through the SECURITY.E procedure.
However, the specific needs of a user may best be addressed by placing all of
their commonly used procedures on a menu, to eliminate the traversing of
menus.

Note that when a user does not have security access to a specific procedure,
that procedure does not appear on their menu, even if you can see that
procedure in the MENU.E procedure.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
None.
