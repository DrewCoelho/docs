## Regenerate On Order File (ORDER.P1)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../ORDER-P1-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The ORDER.P1 procedure recalculates and sets the on order quantities in the
inventory (INV) and on order (ORDER) files from all files which may replenish
inventory such as purchase orders and work orders.

**Frequency of Use**
The on order quantities are maintained automatically as purchase orders and
work orders are processed. Therefore, the only time you really need to run
this procedure is when the file has been corrupted or records are being
converted from another system.

**Prerequisites**
None.
