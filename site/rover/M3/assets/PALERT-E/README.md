**Purpose**
The Process Alert procedure is used to setup an alert for monitoring by the
system. The user creates an alert by selecting from a list of predefined
templates (defined with PADEF.E) and supplying any information requested.
These alerts may be defined as one time events where the event is deleted
after the event was triggered, or as persistent events that continue to report
on recurring events.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
Setup of the appropriate definitions with the PADEF.E procedure.
