## Association Definitions

![](./PD-E-3.jpg)

| **Association ID**|  Enter the name of the association you wish to define.

-  
**Sub Association of**|  If this association is a sub association within a
value level association then enter the name of the value level association.
Otherwise leave this field null. All of the fields specified in a sub
association must also be specified in the value association.

**Pause after entry**|  Enter a Y if you want the user to have the option of
accessing a specified prompt number after the last prompt of the dataset has
been entered. This would most often be used when only one set of the
associated data appears on the screen at one time.

**Association fields**|  Enter the record and temporary fields included in
this association. Be sure to include any fields which are not prompted but are
still part of the association. This will insure that the associated data
remains intact.
