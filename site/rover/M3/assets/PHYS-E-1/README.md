| **Control**|  Normally, the tag number is the key to the CYCLE file. For the
purposes of this entry screen, the tag number is being prompted below so that
multiple tags can be entered on a single screen for faster data entry. No
entry is allowed for this field in this procedure.

-  
**Tag**|  Enter the control number assigned to the tag which you are entering.

**Part Number**|  The part number counted on this tag.

**Invloc**|  The inventory location where this part was counted.

**St**|  This is the current status of this tag: N = New C = Counted V = Void.
Entering a status of "V" is the same as entering a status of "C" with a
quantity of zero.

**Quantity**|  Enter the actual quantity counted for this part at the
specified inventory location, as written on the tag by the counter.

**Lot No**|  Displays the lot number, if any, associated with the count
entered.

**Bin.No**|  Enter the bin number associated with the count entered. This
field is only valid for locations which are bin controlled.

**Date**|  Enter the date on which this part was counted. This will default to
the count date entered on the previous tag.

**Init**|  Enter the initials of the person who performed the count for this
tag. This will default to the initials entered for the previous tag.

**Recount**|  This box will be checked if the tag was generated during the
recount process.
