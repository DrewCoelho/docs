## Mass Close Open Purchase Orders (PO.P4)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../PO-P4-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The purpose of PO.P4 is to mass close open purchase orders through a specified
cutoff date. The cutoff date is a required field. Open orders created on or
before the selected date will be included unless there is a pending receipt
against the order.

This process can be run for selected vendors. There is, also, an option to run
the procedure in trial mode before updating the purchase order (i.e. PO) file.
This option gives you the opportunity to review the purchase orders that will
be closed before actually closing them.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.
