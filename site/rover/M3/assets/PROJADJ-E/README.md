## Project Cost and Revenue Adjustments (PROJADJ.E)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../PROJADJ-E-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The project system provides the ability to associate various transactions to a
project which are accumulated to provide total values for cost and revenue. In
cases where it is not possible or desirable to associate one of these
transactions the PROJADJ.E procedure provides a method for entering adjusting
tranactions to a project. You may enter adjustments for cost or revenue to a
specific task. It should be noted that entering an adjustment transaction does
not create a register record that impacts the financial system. Therefore, if
such an entry is required it must be made through a manual journal entry using
the [GLTRANS.E](../GLTRANS-E/README.md) procedure.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
Entry of the project using [PROJECT.E](../PROJECT-E/README.md).
