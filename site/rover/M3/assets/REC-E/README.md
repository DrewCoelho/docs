## View/Edit Record (REC.E)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../REC-E-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The REC.E procedure allows you to view any record that is maintained in a file
defined through the FDICT.E procedure. In addition to viewing a record you may
also manually edit and save the contents of the record. You may change the
data in internal or converted format and may insert and delete values and sub-
values. When values or sub-values are added any fields in the same association
as the field being changed will be adjusted as well to maintain the integrity
of the data association.

Note: This procedure makes no attempt to validate any changes that are made.
It is basically the same as changing the data through an editor except that it
assists in maintaining the integrity of the data associations. Therefore
editing must be done with sufficient knowledge of the data structure and its
impact on related processes.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
None.
