| **Job ID**|  Enter a unique ID if you wish to enter and save the parameters
to this procedure for future use. If you only need to run the procedure and do
not want to save your entry then you may leave this field empty.

-  
**Destination**|  Select the destination for the output from this procedure.

**Process**|  Select the method to be used for processing the report.
Foreground is always available and must be used when output is directed to
anything other than a system printer (i.e. printers spooled through the
database on the host computer.) Depending on your setup there may be various
batch process queues available in the list that allow you to submit the job
for processing in the background or at a predefined time such as overnight. A
system printer must be specified when using these queues.

**Format**|  Select the format for the output. The availability of other
formats depends on what is allowed by each procedure. Possible formats include
Text, Excel, Word, PDF, HTML, Comma delimited and Tab delimited.

**Layout**|  You may indicate the layout of the printed page by specifying the
appropriate setting in this field. Set the value to Portrait if the page is to
be oriented with the shorter dimension (usually 8.5 inches) at the top or
Landscape if the longer dimension (usually 11 inches) is to be at the top.
Portrait will always be available but Landscape is dependent on the output
destination and may not be available in all cases.

**Copies**|  Enter the number of copies to be printed.

**Run Process**|  Click on the button to run the process. This performs the
save function which may also be activated by clicking the save button in the
tool bar or pressing the F9 key or Ctrl+S.

the report.

printed.

**Sort Fields**|  Enter the fields to be used in determining the order in
which the data on the report will be sorted. Enter the the fields in order of
their precedence in the sort sequence. For example, if you wanted to sort the
customer file by name within ZIP code, you would enter ZIP first and Name
second.

which the associated field is to be sorted:

field is used as a break point.

If a break point is enabled then any totals that are being accumulated will be
printed when the value of the associated field changes from one value to
another. The "P" option also causes a new page to be started after the break
point.

**Suppress Detail**|  Check this box if you want to suppress the printing of
detailed data. When this option is selected, only the totals are printed at
the specified break points.

**Double Space**|  Check this box if you want to print the report with a space
between each detail item.

**Max Width**|  If you want to force the output to be displayed as rows
instead of columns you may do so by limiting the number of characters allowed
