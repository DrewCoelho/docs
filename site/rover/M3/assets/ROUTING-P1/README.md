<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../ROUTING-P1-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The ROUTING.P1 procedure is used to reload the work center data into the
routing records.

This procedure may be run for selected work centers, or for all work centers
by entering "ALL" in the work center prompt.

This procedure would be used in the event that some setting or time in the
work center file has been changed and you wish to propagate the new
information to all Routing records, rather than update them one at a time.

**Frequency of Use**
As needed.

**Prerequisites**
The correct information must be present in the work center file.
