**Purpose**
The SECURITY.E3 procedure provides the ability to view and update the access
rights to a particular procedure for all users of that procedure. You indicate
the name of the account and procedure to be updated and a list of current
users appears. You may then make changes to the access rights of these users
and also add additional users that did not already have access to the
procedure. When you save the procedure all of the user security settings are
updated.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
The entries made here will not take effect until the account has been secured
with ACCOUNT.CONTROL.
