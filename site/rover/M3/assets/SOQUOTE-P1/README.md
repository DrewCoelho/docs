<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../SOQUOTE-P1-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The SOQUOTE.P1 procedure rebuilds the sales order quotation to part number
cross reference file (SOQPART).

**Frequency of Use**
The cross-reference is maintained automatically as quotes are entered.
Therefore, the only time you really need to run this procedure is when the
file has been corrupted or records have been purged from the quote file.

**Prerequisites**
None.
