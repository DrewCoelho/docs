## Payment Terms Entry (TERMS.E)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../TERMS-E-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The TERMS.E procedure is used to define the various payment terms which will
be used in processing Accounts Payable and Receivable transactions. Each
record specifies a name by which the terms will be referenced and all of the
data required for the system to properly process transactions which are
affected by payment terms.

**Frequency of Use**
Terms codes are usually defined when the system is being setup prior to any
transaction processing. New codes may be added at any time, but care must be
taken to insure that existing codes which are currently being referenced by
other records in the system are not changed or deleted.

**Prerequisites**
None.
