**Quantity**|  Enter the number of items being moved.

**Loc**|  Enter the location that the material is being moved from.

**WO**|  Enter the work order from which the item is being moved. An entry is
required in this field only if the from location is a type "WO".

moving items in from a non-physical location and are creating a new lot

work order for the quantity being removed. An entry in this field is required

number entered in the from lot field. You may change it to another lot number
if you are splitting the lot or consolidating items from one lot into another.
If you leave this field blank it is assumed that you want the system to assign
a new lot number.

field will default to the first bin number found in the inventory location.
