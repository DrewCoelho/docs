<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Failure Data ](RMAREC-E4-1/README.md)   
[ Change History ](RMAREC-E4-2/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The RMAREC.E4 procedure is used to enter failure information about the items on the RMA receipt. This information is used to generate statistics about the failure rate for certain products and the occurance of certain types of failure conditions. It is also used to calculate the mean time between failure for a group of products. Failure information may also be entered using [ RMAREC.E2 ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/AP-E/AP-E-1/CURRENCY-CONTROL/SO-E/MRK-CONTROL/MRK-CONTROL-2/RMA-E/RMA-E-1/RMAREC-E2) , however it may not be used once the receipt has been posted. RMAREC.E4 can be used even after the receipt has been posted and only allows failure information to be updated, quantities and receipt dates may not be changed. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Creation of an RMA receipt with [ RMAREC.E ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/AP-E/AP-E-1/CURRENCY-CONTROL/SO-E/MRK-CONTROL/MRK-CONTROL-2/RMA-E/RMA-E-1/RMAREC-E2/RMAREC-E) or [ RMAREC.E2 ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/AP-E/AP-E-1/CURRENCY-CONTROL/SO-E/MRK-CONTROL/MRK-CONTROL-2/RMA-E/RMA-E-1/RMAREC-E2) .
