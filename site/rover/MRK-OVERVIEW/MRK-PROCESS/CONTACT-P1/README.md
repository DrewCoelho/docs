##  Contact Cross-Reference Rebuild Process (CONTACT.P1)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](CONTACT-P1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The CONTACT.P1 procedure rebuilds the name and phone number cross-reference
fields to provide for faster and easier lookups.

**Frequency of Use**  
The cross-references is maintained automatically as contact records are
entered. Therefore, the only time you really need to run this procedure is
when the file has been corrupted, or when initially converted.

**Prerequisites**  
The name and phone cross reference fields should be indexed in the FDICT.E
procedure.
