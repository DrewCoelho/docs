[ Form Details ](SO-P7-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The purpose of SO.P7 is to mass close open sales orders through a specified
cutoff date. The cutoff date is a required field. Open orders created on or
before the selected date will be included unless there is a pending shipment
against the order.  
  
This process can be run for selected customers. There is, also, an option to
run the procedure in trial mode before updating the sales order (i.e. SO)
file. This option gives you the opportunity to review the sales orders that
will be closed before actually closing them.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**
