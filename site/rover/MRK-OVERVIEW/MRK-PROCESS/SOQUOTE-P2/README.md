[ Form Details ](SOQUOTE-P2-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The purpose of SOQUOTE.P2 is to mass close sales order quotes through a
specified cutoff date. There is an option to select the quotes based on either
the date the quote was created or the date the quote was valid thru.  
  
Any quote without a status code is considered to be active or open. The status
codes entered on the quotes are user defined. Therefore, you should enter the
code in the status field that represents a closed quote for your company.  
  
When you are ready to close the soquote records, select the "update file"
option. Not selecting this option will allow you to view the soquote records
that will be closed before actually updating them.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.
