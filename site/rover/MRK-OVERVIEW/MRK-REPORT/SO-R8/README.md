[ Form Details ](SO-R8-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The SO.R8 procedure provides a sales backlog report by part or model number in
a spreadsheet like format. This listing will include shipments in a "N" (new
or pending) status. The report generates twelve (10) columns of monthly
backlog figures beginning with the month and year specified by the user. A
prior and future column are also included to show the sales backlog outside of
the chosen reporting period. You may also select the summary option which
displays only the totals for each monthly column.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.

**Data Fields**

**Part** The part number whose sales backlog figures are displayed in each
column.

labeled "Prior" and "Future" respectively.  
**Qty** The total number of the associated part number scheduled for shipment
