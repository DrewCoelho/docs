## Rover ERP Customer Portal Overview

The Rover ERP Customer Portal is a secure, self-service web platform that
provides your customers with real-time access to their key account
information. Designed for convenience and transparency, the portal makes it
easy to manage invoices, service interactions and orders from a single
dashboard.

### Key Features & Capabilities

#### 1. Dashboard Overview

Upon login, customers see a dashboard with at-a-glance metrics for:

- **Invoices** – total amount spent, current balance and trends.
- **Tickets** – support or service tickets created, open or closed.
- **Orders** – orders placed or closed with real-time status updates.

Each panel updates dynamically with the most recent business date so your
customers can proactively manage financial and operational activity.

#### 2. Invoices Module

**Invoice List View**

Customers can sort and filter a table of invoices that shows:

- **Invoice Number** (linked for details or download)
- **Due Date**
- **Type** (Invoice, Credit, etc.)
- **Invoice Amount** and **Balance**
- **Status** (Outstanding, Paid)
- **Pay** button for quick payment

**Download & Self-Service**

Each invoice can be downloaded as a PDF with a single click.

**Online Payment**

Outstanding invoices are clearly marked and can be paid instantly through
the **Click to Pay** button, reducing days sales outstanding.

#### 3. Ticketing / Customer Service

**Tickets Panel**

Visibility into all customer service or support tickets ("cases" in Salesforce
terminology) including open, in-progress and closed items.

**Self-Service Tracking**

Customers can check the status of their requests at any time which enhances
transparency and reduces the need for phone or email follow-up.

#### 4. Orders Module

**Order Status**

Summary and drill-down views for all orders placed, shipped or closed.

**Order Details**

Access order history, download related documents and track progress,
shipment or delivery statuses in real time.

#### 5. User Experience & Accessibility

**Responsive Web Application**

Fully browser-based and device-responsive so no software installation is
required.

**Security & Personalization**

Access is controlled through email/contact records in the customer master
file. Each customer's portal displays only their company's data.

**Self-Service Philosophy**

Designed to minimize support load and maximize independence by putting
critical information and actions directly in the user's hands.

### How It Works (Sample User Flow)

1. **Login** – Customer authenticates via a secure login page.
2. **Dashboard** – Real-time metrics for invoice totals, open tickets and
   recent orders.
3. **Invoices** – View or download invoice PDFs and pay outstanding amounts
   online.
4. **Support** – Check ticket status or submit a new service request.
5. **Orders** – Track order fulfillment or download shipping documents.

### Benefits for Your Customers

- **Immediate Insight** – No waiting on customer service for invoices, orders or ticket status.
- **Faster Payments** – Direct online payment shortens AR cycles.
- **Enhanced Transparency** – Customers always know where they stand.
- **Reduced Support Overhead** – Fewer routine calls and emails to your team.
- **Audit‑Ready** – All documents are downloadable for compliance and audit needs.

### Administrative Notes

- **Setup** – Portal access is managed via email records and security roles
  in the ERP customer master.
- **Customization** – The layout, fields and actions can be tailored to your
  organization's specific workflows.
- **Integration** – Tightly integrated with Rover's CRM, financials and
  service management modules to ensure data consistency and up-to-date information.
