# Production Overview

<PageHeader />

The Production workspace in Rover ERP empowers users to manage and schedule all manufacturing activities with precision. Using a single, browser-based interface, users can plan, adjust, and monitor every production detail—from work order scheduling to status tracking, resource allocation, and shop floor execution.

## Key Sections & Tabs

1. **General Production Information**
   - **Work Order Info:** View and edit the work order number, part number, description, quantity, due date, and current status.
   - **Production Group:** Assign work orders to production groups for streamlined scheduling and batch management.
   - **Work Center Details:** Specify work center(s) required for each operation (e.g., Assembly, Painting, Drying).

2. **Tabs for Deep Production Control & Insight**
   The main production workspace is organized into several tabs, each providing direct access to a vital area of the manufacturing process:

   **a. Scheduling**
   - **Gantt Chart Visualization:** Interactive timeline to schedule, sequence, and adjust production operations.
   - **Schedule Groups:** Group work orders by work center for focused planning (e.g., all Dryer operations in one group).
   - **Dynamic Controls:** Select a group, and the chart instantly updates to display only relevant work centers and their associated work orders.
   - **Drag-and-Drop:** Move work orders on the timeline, change duration, or shift between work centers as needs change.
   - **Add Operations:** Insert additional steps (e.g., washout after production) right from the schedule.
   - **Real-Time Updates:** Any changes in scheduling are immediately reflected throughout the workspace.

   **b. Work Orders**
   - **Work Order List:** Comprehensive grid view of all work orders—sortable and filterable by status, date, part, work center, and more.
   - **Multi-Tab Work Order Viewing:** Open multiple work orders in separate tabs for side-by-side review and editing.
   - **Status Tracking:** Instantly see if orders are Open, Closed, Released, Pulled, etc., with color-coded indicators.
   - **Field Editing:** Edit only permitted fields (such as Notes) for communication and record-keeping, while other fields remain read-only for security.

   **c. Operations**
   - **Operation Steps:** Detailed breakdown of steps required to complete each work order, including start/end dates, work center assignments, and resources used.
   - **Move Operations:** Reassign operations between work centers as capacity and availability change.

   **d. Notes & Attachments**
   - **Notes Field:** Enter and update key production notes or shift hand-off messages.
   - **Attachments:** Store work instructions, drawings, or quality documents directly on the work order.

3. **Business Intelligence, Integrations, and Actions**
   - **Dashboard Widgets:** Instantly see total open work orders, current production status, bottlenecks, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
   - **Role-Based Access:** Each tab or field is visible only to those with permission (e.g., production managers, schedulers, floor leads).
   - **API & Extensibility:** All production data and schedules are available via API for integration with MES, quality, or reporting systems.
