# Quotes & Orders

<PageHeader />

The Quotes & Orders subsection of the Rover Sales module enables users to rapidly generate quotes, convert quotes to orders, and process new sales orders—all within a unified, browser-based interface. The Quote to Order workflow is designed for both field sales representatives and in-house sales teams, supporting high-velocity transaction environments and customer-specific pricing.

## 1. Quote Creation
### Initiate a Quote
- Select an existing customer or quickly add a new one.
- Browse or search the product catalog by category, family, or attributes.
- Add products to the quote, adjust quantities, and apply customer-specific pricing or discounts.
- Save, print, or email the quote directly to the customer.

### Quote Tracking
- All quotes are accessible from the customer record, with status indicators (open, sent, accepted, lost).
- Easily duplicate quotes for similar future orders or reference prior pricing.

## 2. Quote-to-Order Conversion
### Seamless Conversion
- Accepted quotes can be instantly converted to active sales orders with one click—no re-entry needed.
- Customer details, pricing, and line items are preserved in the conversion.

### Approval Workflow
- Optionally require approval for discounts, special terms, or high-value orders.

### Digital Signatures
- Collect digital signatures at the time of conversion for verification and compliance.

## 3. Order Entry & Processing
### Order Building
- Build new sales orders by selecting products, editing quantities, and capturing ship-to details.
- Specify order type (e.g., standard, drop ship, pickup), enter PO number, and select ship dates.

### Cart & Checkout
- View the order summary, adjust as needed, and finalize the transaction.
- For retail environments, process payment via multiple tenders (cash, card, check). For B2B/field sales, generate signed PDFs or email receipts.

### Order Confirmation
- Generate order confirmation documents, which may include customer signatures, date/time stamps, and full order details.
- Orders are instantly reflected in customer history, accounts receivable, and inventory.

## 4. Order & Quote Management
### Order Lookup
- Search for any order or quote by customer, date, or status.
- Drill into order details, check fulfillment progress, or print/email documents.

### Audit & Change History
- All quote/order actions are logged for traceability and compliance.

### Document Handling
- Download receipts, signed confirmations, and order details for records or customer reference.
