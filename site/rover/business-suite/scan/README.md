Rover Scan is the dedicated, browser-based mobile operations hub within the Rover ERP Web Application. Designed for warehouse, shop floor, and field service teams, it enables fast, barcode-driven workflows on any device—smartphones, tablets, or traditional desktops—without the need for proprietary hardware or installed software.

## Recent Enhancements

- **Pack Verification** – scan items during packing to verify shipment contents and print packing lists or labels.
- **Scanner Configuration** – set prefix or suffix values for scanners directly in client settings.
- **User Interface Refresh** – clearer prompts, highlighted next actions and audible alerts on errors.
- **Multi‑Language Labels** – buttons and prompts support multiple languages for a diverse workforce.

## Key Features & Functionalities

The main Rover Scan interface presents users with a series of high-contrast, touch-friendly tiles for each primary operation:

1. **Transfer**
   - Move inventory between locations (stock room, finished goods, staging, etc.).
   - Supports bin-to-bin and location-to-location transactions.
   - Scan or type part numbers, enter quantities, and capture both “from” and “to” details.
   - Fully compatible with bin-controlled or reference-only inventory models.
   - Track lot numbers for regulatory compliance (e.g., FDA, ISO, FAA) and traceability.
2. **Inventory Check**
   - Instantly scan or type part numbers to see on-hand quantity, locations, bin assignments, and part descriptions.
   - Provides unit-of-measure, lot/batch, and other custom field details in real-time.
   - Highly optimized for handheld device usage and rapid cycle counts.
3. **Picking**
   - Barcode-driven picking workflow for fulfilling sales or work orders.
   - Integrates with pick lists (printable or digital), allowing users to scan picked items and update order status in real time.
   - Reduces manual entry and improves picking accuracy.
4. **Start Job / End Job**
   - **Start Job:** Scan employee badge, enter/select work order and operation, and timestamp the beginning of work.
   - **End Job:** Close out the operation, logging elapsed time (minus pre-planned breaks) and attributing labor cost to the job.
   - Every entry is scannable for speed—badges, work order barcodes, etc.
5. **Scan Shipment**
   - Streamlines packing and shipment verification.
   - Scan items and shipping containers to validate order accuracy before dispatch.
   - Enables bin or staging location transfers as part of the shipment workflow.
6. **Physical Count / Physical Recount**
   - Supports periodic and ad hoc inventory counts.
   - Users can initiate new counts or quickly perform recounts to verify previous results.
   - All data entry is scannable to reduce errors and speed up the process.
7. **WO Completion (Work Order Completion)**
   - Finalize production or assembly jobs by scanning finished items.
   - Captures completion quantities, locations, and optionally updates inventory in real time.
   - Ensures accountability and traceability for shop floor operations.

## Device Compatibility & User Experience

- **Device-Responsive:** Fully adapts to iPads, iPhones, Android devices (such as Honeywell scanners), and desktop browsers. The interface auto-detects device type and optimizes layout for best usability.
- **No App Required:** Runs in any modern web browser—no software installation, no device lock-in.
- **Barcode-First Workflow:** All fields can be filled by scanning, enabling hands-free or one-touch operation.
- **Simple Navigation:** Users can jump between modules with a single tap, minimizing time spent in the application and maximizing time on the shop/warehouse floor.

## Warehouse and Field Operations Integration

- **Bin Management:** Supports both reference and true bin-controlled locations, aligning with best practices in warehouse management and SAP-style logistics.
- **Lot/Batch Tracking:** Enables tracking of material attributes (e.g., expiration date, heat number, thickness) for regulated industries or quality control.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Use as a standalone warehouse management tool or as part of a broader Rover ERP deployment.

## Customization & Extensibility

- **Custom Fields:** Additional data capture (e.g., heat numbers, material types) can be enabled per customer requirements.
- **API-Driven:** Easily connects to other ERP modules or legacy systems for phased rollouts and staged migrations.
- **Role-Based Access:** Users see only the functions relevant to their role (e.g., receiving, picking, production, shipping).

## Typical Use Cases

- Inventory transfers between multiple locations or production stages
- Real-time inventory checks during receiving, picking, or audits
- Labor tracking for job-based costing and payroll accuracy
- Barcode-driven shipping verification and error-proof dispatching
- Ad hoc or scheduled cycle counting
- Production completion tracking and lot/batch reporting

## Screenshot Reference

Screenshot Key:
- Each orange tile represents a dedicated function—tap or click to access.
- The left sidebar provides quick navigation to related modules and functions.

## Benefits

- **Increased Accuracy:** Barcode scanning reduces manual errors and speeds up warehouse transactions.
- **Productivity Gains:** Touch-first, scan-first design means operators can work faster and with less training.
- **Flexibility:** Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) ready; works on any hardware platform.
- **Data Integrity:** Real-time sync with the core Rover ERP database ensures data is always up-to-date.

## Administrative Notes

- **User Permissions:** Functions can be shown/hidden based on job role or security group.
- **Reporting:** All scan activities are logged for audit, reporting, and process improvement.
